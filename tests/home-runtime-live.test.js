// The pool, against a real Home Assistant.
//
// The pure tests in tests/home-runtime.test.js prove the refcounting, the cap,
// the breaker and the eviction boundary with a fake bridge, because a working
// house cannot be asked to fail its next five connects on cue. What they cannot
// prove is the claim the whole module exists for: that a second call really
// rides the first WebSocket instead of opening another one against somebody's
// instance. That needs a real socket and a real house, so it lives here.
//
// Self-skipping, and it builds its own house. The lane has ONE way to get a
// real Home Assistant, so this file asks for it rather than describing it:
//
//   npm run test:home:live
//   HOME_LIVE=1 HOME_ALLOW_LOCAL_INSTANCE=1 npx vitest run tests/home-runtime-live.test.js
//
// Pointing at a house you already have still works, via HOME_ASSISTANT_URL and
// HOME_ASSISTANT_TOKEN, because acquireHomeInstance prefers those when set.
//
// HOME_ALLOW_LOCAL_INSTANCE=1 is the seam documented in
// api/_lib/home-url-guard.js, and unlike every other live file in the lane this
// one needs it: the runtime dials the house through the same reachability guard
// the API uses, and a harness instance lands on loopback, which that guard
// refuses. It is part of the gate rather than a hard failure so that a run
// without it skips with a reason instead of reporting the guard as a bug.
//
// Never mocked. A fake instance is what hid Home Assistant's own
// `intent__HassTurnOff` performing an UNLOCK on a lock, which is the single most
// important thing this lane learned.
