// The Home lane's scoring rules, exercised directly.
//
// The one thing this file is really for: proving that a single dark house does
// NOT read as an outage, and that ten of them at once does. Everything else in
// the observability lane is downstream of getting that distinction right, and it
// is the distinction that is easy to break in a refactor and impossible to
// notice until somebody is paged at 3am for a stranger's router.
//
// `homeHealthVerdict` and `noteSubscriberSample` are pure, so every threshold is
// asserted here without a database. The end-to-end proof against a real Postgres
// and a real Home Assistant is in the order 13 report.
