/**
 * public/animations/registry.json is the developer-facing catalogue of every
 * animation asset, and its own header tells the reader to consult it first.
 * A registry that has drifted is worse than none: it once drifted to 37 built
 * clips, with `source_fbx` paths pointing into a directory that has held no FBX
 * since the sources moved to animation-sources/, and `agent_slots` recording
 * slot assignments that had moved to other clips.
 *
 * scripts/sync-animation-registry.mjs derives the whole block from the manifest,
 * the clip config and the live slot map. These tests fail if the committed file
 * is not what that script would produce, so the catalogue cannot silently rot.
