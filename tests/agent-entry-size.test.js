// Unit tests for resolveEntrySize (api/_lib/agent-trade-guards.js): the guard
// that decides whether an underfunded sniper arm shrinks its buy or sits out.
//
// The bug this pins down: a wallet holding more than the entry headroom (fee +
// ATA rent) but less than MIN_OPERATIONAL_WALLET_SOL passed the old inline check
// and then aborted at the firewall round-trip probe / pre-broadcast CU
// simulation it could not afford to run. The arm re-attempted every candidate
// and booked a SIM_FAILED each time. Observed live on the boost-ride arm: 82
// consecutive SIM_FAILED in 24h from a 0.0048 SOL wallet, zero buys.
//
// Pure function, no mocks needed.
