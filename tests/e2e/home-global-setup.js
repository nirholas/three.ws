/**
 * Everything the home lane's e2e journeys need, before the first browser opens.
 *
 * The journeys drive the REAL product against a REAL Home Assistant, so the
 * stack is three processes and no stubs anywhere in it:
 *
 *   Home Assistant   a container from scripts/home-test-instance.mjs, seeded
 *   the API          node server/index.mjs, the same handlers Cloud Run runs
 *   the frontend     vite, with DEV_API_PROXY pointed at that API
 *
 * The house lives on 127.0.0.1, which both the browser and the server treat as
 * reachable: `normalizeBaseUrl` exempts loopback from the private-host refusal
 * precisely so a developer running Home Assistant on this machine still works.
 * That exemption is what makes an honest end-to-end run possible here, and
 * journey 10 proves the refusal still fires for every other private host.
 *
 * Two accounts are provisioned, an owner and a guest, because journey 7 is
 * about one member being refused something the other is allowed. They are
 * created through the real signup page ONCE and then reused for every later
 * run: account creation is rate limited to five per hour per IP, so a setup
 * that registered on every run would work twice and then start reporting the
 * rate limiter as a product failure.
