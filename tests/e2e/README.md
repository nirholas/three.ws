# Browser end-to-end specs (Playwright)

Real-Chromium specs that drive product UI against the Vite dev server. Kept
separate from Vitest (which only globs `*.test.js`) by the `.spec.js` suffix and
`testDir: tests/e2e` in [`playwright.config.js`](../../playwright.config.js).

## Running

```bash
# whole suite (Vitest unit + Playwright e2e)
npm test

# just the browser specs
npm run test:e2e                                  # = playwright test

# one spec, fast iteration (no retries, single worker)
npx playwright test tests/e2e/launch-token-flow.spec.js --retries=0 --workers=1
npx playwright test tests/e2e/coin-buy-trade.spec.js   --retries=0 --workers=1
```

### Pre-start the dev server (avoids cold-start flakiness)

`playwright.config.js` will start `npm run dev` itself, but a cold Vite server
plus the first transform of the Solana/pump SDK module graph can take 30–60s. To
keep that cost out of the per-test budget, **pre-start a dedicated dev server**
and let Playwright reuse it (`reuseExistingServer` is on when `CI` is unset):

```bash
npm run dev            # leave running on :3000 in another shell
npx playwright test    # reuses the running server
```

Do not wait on `networkidle` in specs — the app holds long-lived connections
(HMR socket, live feeds). Wait on concrete DOM/state instead.

## The home lane

The smart-home journeys live behind their own config,
[`playwright.home.config.js`](../../playwright.home.config.js), and their own ports. They are not
part of `npm run test:e2e`, because a spec about `/club` has no business booting a house.

```bash
npm run test:home:live         # every live test in the lane, one shared house
npm run test:home:e2e          # the ten journeys, against a real Home Assistant
npm run home:instance          # just the house: prints its URL and token
npm run home:instance:down     # remove it and its config directory
npm run home:matrix            # the release matrix (pulls one HA image at a time)
```

The lane's three suites, from cheapest to most expensive:

| Suite | Command | Needs |
|---|---|---|
| Pure, over a recording of a real instance | `npx vitest run packages/home-bridge` | nothing |
| Live, against a real house | `npm run test:home:live` | Docker, or a house you already have |
| The ten browser journeys | `npm run test:home:e2e` | Docker, `.env.local` with `DATABASE_URL` |

### What `npm run test:home:live` runs

[`scripts/home-live-tests.mjs`](../../scripts/home-live-tests.mjs) collects every test file that
imports [`tests/_helpers/home-instance.js`](../_helpers/home-instance.js) and runs them together
against one shared house. The list is derived from that import rather than typed out, so a new
live test cannot be added and then quietly left out of the suite.

It supplies the four things those files need, which is why they used to skip on most machines:

| Variable | Why |
|---|---|
| `HOME_LIVE=1` | lets the helper build the house through the harness |
| `HOME_ALLOW_LOCAL_INSTANCE=1` | the seam in [`api/_lib/home-url-guard.js`](../../api/_lib/home-url-guard.js). A house you run yourself lands on loopback, and the reachability guard refuses loopback in production. `tests/home-runtime-live.test.js` dials through that guard and skips without it. |
| `WALLET_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | encrypts the throwaway rows the run creates. Generated per run when unset, exactly as the Playwright config does. |
| `JWT_SECRET` | signs the sessions the HTTP tiers mint. Generated the same way. |

`DATABASE_URL` comes from `.env.local`. Without it the database tiers skip themselves rather than
failing, so a machine with Docker but no database still runs the bridge and MCP tiers.

### What `npm run test:home:e2e` actually starts

Three processes and no stubs anywhere between the click and the assertion:

1. **Home Assistant**, from [`scripts/home-test-instance.mjs`](../../scripts/home-test-instance.mjs):
   a container on a free port, onboarded through the real API, seeded with a floor, four rooms,
   scenes, `mcp_server`, and a lock exposed to Assist.
2. **The API**, `node server/index.mjs` on `:8099`: the same handlers Cloud Run runs, against the
   database in `.env.local`.
3. **The frontend**, `vite` on `:3020`, with `DEV_API_PROXY` pointed at that API.

Dedicated ports and `reuseExistingServer: false` are deliberate. Other agents run their own
`npm run dev` on `:3000` in this worktree, and reusing one is not a smaller version of this
stack: its `/api` proxy points at **production**, so the run silently tests the wrong API and
reports `No API route matches /api/home` as though the handler were missing.

The house lives on `127.0.0.1`, which both the browser and the server accept because
`normalizeBaseUrl` exempts loopback from the private-host refusal, so a developer running Home
Assistant on this machine still works. Journey 10 proves the refusal still fires for every other
private host.

### Rules this lane holds

- **Assert on the house, never on our own text.** Every journey that touches a lock reads that
  lock's state back out of Home Assistant. A confirmation card that renders perfectly while the
  deadbolt moves anyway is the exact failure this lane exists to catch.
- **No `waitForTimeout`.** Wait for a condition: the state in Home Assistant, the element, the
  event. `waitForState` in [`tests/_helpers/home-instance.js`](../_helpers/home-instance.js) is
  the tool for the first one.
- **No retries.** `retries: 0`, on purpose. A journey that only passes on the second attempt has
  told us something, and hiding it is how the finding gets lost. A flaky test on a door is worse
  than an absent one: fix it or delete it, in the session it is found.
- **Two accounts, provisioned once.** Account creation is limited to five per hour per IP, so the
  owner and guest accounts are created through the real signup page once and reused from
  `.ha-config-e2e-accounts.json` (gitignored: real credentials).

### Cleaning up

The house outlives the run on purpose, so ten consecutive runs pay for one boot:

```bash
npm run home:instance:down     # or: node scripts/home-test-instance.mjs --down --name lane
```

The harness only ever touches containers it labelled itself, so it can never remove another
agent's Home Assistant on this machine.

## The conversion-path specs

`launch-token-flow.spec.js` and `coin-buy-trade.spec.js` cover the platform's
most important path — launching a coin and trading it. Both follow the same
fidelity contract as `galaxy.spec.js`:

- **Real product code, driven — not re-implemented.** The specs import and run
  the actual modules ([`src/pump/launch-token-modal.js`](../../src/pump/launch-token-modal.js),
  [`src/game/coin-buy.js`](../../src/game/coin-buy.js)) on a minimal same-origin
  harness page so the dev server still resolves `/src/*` imports and relative
  `/api/*` fetches without booting the heavy homepage.
- **Endpoints fulfilled at the route layer with realistic payloads.** Vite dev
  proxies `/api/*` to production, so the launch-quote / launch-prep /
  launch-confirm endpoints, the pump buy/sell prep+confirm endpoints, and the
  Solana RPC proxy are intercepted with `page.route` to stay deterministic and
  never touch a real chain. The client makes the real fetches; the specs assert
  the real prep/confirm calls fire with the expected body. Prep transactions are
  genuine, parseable `@solana/web3.js` transactions built in Node.
- **`window.solana` is the only stubbed surface** — it is an external browser
  extension, not our code or a real API. Its `signTransaction` returns a
  serialized transaction exactly as a real wallet would, so the broadcast path
  runs for real against the fulfilled RPC.

### `launch-token-flow.spec.js` — all four launch steps

1. step 1 form validation (malformed symbol rejected, flow blocked)
2. step 2 cost breakdown + bonding-curve chart render
3. step 3 wallet connect arms the launch button
4. step 4 sign → broadcast → confirm → success share card (mint chip, share
   link, pump.fun link), asserting real `launch-prep` + `launch-confirm` fire
5. a broadcast failure surfaces specific, actionable copy (no generic catch-all)

### `coin-buy-trade.spec.js` — the buy/sell trade widget

1. wallet gating (connect → buy CTA)
2. lifecycle stage pill: a bonding-curve coin vs a graduated coin render
   distinct, unmistakable states (driven by the real `/api/pump/quote`
   detection)
3. SOL buy happy path: prep → sign → broadcast → settle
4. USDC buy happy path on a graduated coin (denomination upgrades to USDC)
5. sell happy path: switch to Sell, enter amount, prep → broadcast
6. a failed prep surfaces specific, actionable copy
