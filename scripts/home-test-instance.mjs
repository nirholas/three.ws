/**
 * A real Home Assistant, on demand, for the home lane's live tests.
 *
 * Every live test in this lane needs the same thing: an instance that is
 * onboarded, holds a long-lived token, and contains a house worth asserting on
 * (floors, areas, a lock, scenes, the MCP server). Before this script each test
 * and each developer built that by hand from the README, which is how six
 * slightly different instances came to exist and how a version difference could
 * hide as "works on my machine".
 *
 *   node scripts/home-test-instance.mjs --up --onboard --seed --json
 *   eval "$(node scripts/home-test-instance.mjs --up --onboard --seed --env)"
 *   node scripts/home-test-instance.mjs --down
 *
 * Flags combine in that order, so one command takes you from nothing to a
 * seeded house and prints the URL and token. Every step is idempotent: running
 * it twice is a no-op that reprints the same connection details.
 *
 * Safety, and read the second half of this before you type `--down`:
 *
 * The harness stamps every container it creates with a label and REFUSES to
 * stop, restart or remove a container that does not carry it, so nothing else
 * running on this machine (the voice lane's own Home Assistant, say) can be
 * taken by a stray name. It also never touches a config directory outside the
 * gitignored `.ha-config-*` prefix, because those directories hold real access
 * tokens.
 *
 * That label says "this harness made it", NOT "you made it". Concurrent agents
 * share this machine and all of them use this script, so a peer's house carries
 * the same label yours does and the check above cannot tell them apart. The
 * lane name is the only thing that separates two houses. Passing somebody
 * else's `--name` to `--down` therefore destroys a house a live run may be
 * inside, which is exactly what happened on 2026-09-09. `assertNotInUse` is the
 * guard that now stands in front of that: a house handed out in the last half
 * hour needs `--force`.
