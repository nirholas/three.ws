// Regenerate prompts/store-submissions/_generated/mcp-listing-source.json: the
// one canonical description of every three.ws MCP server that any directory
// listing (official registry, Smithery, Glama, mcp.so, PulseMCP, LobeHub) is
// written from.
//
// Why it is generated. Every factual field a directory shows already exists in
// a server*.json manifest: the registry name, display title, description,
// version, npm identifier or remote URL, and which environment variables are
// actually required. Restating them by hand is how the file ended up six
// servers short and thirty-five versions behind while still calling itself the
// source of truth. Only the marketing layer a manifest has no room for
// (tagline, category, keyword tags, example prompts) is curated, and it lives
// in the OVERLAY below.
//
// A server with no overlay entry still generates, carrying its manifest
// description as its tagline. `--check` fails when a server is missing curated
// copy, so a new package cannot land as a blank directory card unnoticed.
//
// Run: node scripts/build-mcp-listing-source.mjs           (write the file)
