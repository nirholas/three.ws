// Build gate: every MCP tool's declared safety annotations must match what its
// handler actually does.
//
// Why this gate exists. MCP `annotations` are not decoration: clients read them
// to decide whether to run a tool without asking the user. `readOnlyHint: true`
// means "this does not modify its environment", and a client that trusts it will
// auto-approve the call. three.ws exposes tools that mint on Solana, settle x402
// payments, and write to the database, so a tool that mutates while advertising
// itself read-only converts a client's auto-approve path into an unattended
// state change. That is the protocol-layer version of the confirm-before-you-
// spend rule the money-moving surfaces already follow.
//
// Until now nothing checked those hints. `audit-mcp-golden.mjs` snapshots them,
// which catches a CHANGE to an annotation but never asks whether it was right:
// a tool born mislabeled stays mislabeled, and `--update` bakes in the next one.
//
// What it checks, per tool, from the AST (never from the tool's name -- a
// name-only heuristic flags `vanity_open` and `link_agent`, which are both
// genuinely read-only, and misses `persona_tip`, which spends):
//   1. readOnlyHint: true + evidence the handler mutates            -> FAIL
//   2. handler moves funds or mints + destructiveHint: false        -> FAIL
//      (an irreversible transfer is the definition of destructive)
//   3. annotations missing entirely                                 -> FAIL
//      (destructiveHint defaults to TRUE when omitted, so an unannotated tool
//      is advertised as destructive; that is safe but always unintended)
//
// Evidence is the handler's transitive call closure: `sql` template tags opening
// with insert/update/delete, plus calls to the known transaction-signing and
// payment-settling helpers. Same-module calls are followed to any depth, and a
// call into an imported function is followed one module hop.
//
// Following a CALL is evidence; merely importing a module that could mutate is
// not. That distinction is load-bearing: a dozen genuinely read-only tools share
// one Solana RPC helper, and treating the import as evidence flagged them all.
//
// Cache and telemetry writes are real writes that are not semantic mutations
// (warming a cache on read, recording usage). Those are exempted individually in
// EXEMPTIONS below, each with a reason, so an exemption is a reviewed line in
// this file rather than a silent hole in the gate.
//
// Run: node scripts/audit-mcp-safety.mjs   (exit 1 on any violation)
//      node scripts/audit-mcp-safety.mjs --list   (print every tool + evidence)

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Reviewed exemptions
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// A tool listed here keeps `readOnlyHint: true` despite carrying write evidence,
// because the evidence is not the effect the caller receives. Keyed
// `tool:evidence`; every entry states why. Two reviewed categories:
//
// 1. Read-through cache fills and observation records: the caller asked for a
//    read and got a read, and the server warmed its own cache (or logged what
//    it just showed) on the way. Each write is wrapped non-fatally at the
//    source, so a failed write still returns the read.
// 2. Transaction BUILDERS that broadcast nothing: the handler assembles an
//    unsigned transaction and returns its bytes for a wallet to sign elsewhere.
//    Instruction constructors (umi's `transferSol`, Metaplex's `mintAsset`) read
//    as transfers and mints to the call-closure scan, but calling one appends an
//    instruction to a builder; it moves no funds and touches no chain. Auto-
//    approving such a call is genuinely safe: nothing changes until the owner
//    signs and some OTHER tool broadcasts. Only add an entry here after checking
//    the handler never reaches a send (`sendAndConfirm`, `hedgedSend`) and never
//    signs with a real keypair.
