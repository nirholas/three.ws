/**
 * Documentation-integrity guard.
 *
 * Docs rot silently: a page gets renamed, a script gets dropped, a directory
 * gets refactored, and the doc that pointed at it keeps shipping a dead link.
 * This audit catches all four classes mechanically, so a broken doc fails a
 * command instead of failing a reader.
 *
 * What it checks:
 *   1. Relative links in Markdown resolve to a real file on disk (URL-decoded,
 *      so api/users/%5Busername%5D.js correctly resolves to the bracket file).
 *   2. Site-absolute links (/create, /docs/x) resolve to a real route: declared
 *      in data/pages.json, matched by a vercel.json route, or backed by a file
 *      under pages/ or public/.
 *   3. `npm run <script>` references name a script that exists in the relevant
 *      package.json, and `node scripts/<x>` references an existing file.
 *   4. Every packages/* and workers/* directory carries a README.md.
 *   5. Every public doc under docs/*.md is registered in data/pages.json, so it
 *      reaches the sitemap, llms.txt and features.json instead of being live at
 *      200 and invisible to every crawler. Docs that are deliberately not
 *      published carry an entry in UNPUBLISHED_DOCS below with the reason.
 *   6. The mirror of 5: every /docs/<slug> declared in data/pages.json has an
 *      article to serve. A declared slug with no Markdown behind it answers 404
 *      while the sitemap, llms.txt and the changelog all advertise it.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/audit-docs.mjs              # audit the whole repo, exit 1 on findings
 *   node scripts/audit-docs.mjs --advisory   # report findings, always exit 0
 *   node scripts/audit-docs.mjs docs/x.md    # audit specific files
 *
 * Deliberately excluded: fenced code blocks and inline code spans (both show
 * the reader templates and examples, not links that must resolve), external
 * URLs (network-dependent), generated aggregates (docs/ALL.md, EVERYTHING.md)
 * whose links are rewritten by their generator, and the internal work-order
 * packs under prompts/ and tasks/. Those packs delete work orders as they are
 * completed (an owner directive, recorded by the retirement notes in each
 * pack's index), so dangling index links there are the documented convention
 * rather than rot. Pass an explicit path to audit them anyway:
 *   node scripts/audit-docs.mjs prompts/finish/_context/roadmap-00-README.md
