// check-announce.mjs - the gate every announcement pack has to clear.
//
// The point of the announcement pipeline is to work a 320-surface backlog down
// without the output reading as machine-generated. That risk is not theoretical:
// 300 posts written from one template converge on one shape, an audience learns
// the shape, and then the announcements that matter get skipped along with the
// rest. Taste does not scale to 300 posts. Mechanical checks do, so the ones
// that can be mechanical are here.
//
// What it enforces, and why each one exists:
//
//   • Media.        A post with no image measured 0.875x against the account
//                   median, and 132 of our 158 measured posts had none. A pack
//                   with no captured frame is not finished.
//   • Alt text.     A post whose payload is an image is unreadable without it.
//   • Length.       Under 100 characters the mechanism is missing (121 of 158
//                   posts, the account's worst-performing shape). Over 280
//                   weighted characters X refuses it outright.
//   • Voice.        No hashtags, no emoji, no em-dashes, and none of the
//                   openings that mark generated marketing copy.
//   • Uniqueness.   No two packs may open with the same clause.
//   • The coin gate. A pack that names a crypto project other than $THREE, or
//                   ships media captured from a surface that renders live
//                   third-party market data, needs recorded owner approval
//                   before it can be committed or posted. This is the operating
//                   rules' commit gate, applied to announcement assets, and it
//                   is the check most likely to actually fire: a screenshot of
//                   a live trading surface bakes whatever tickers were on
//                   screen into a committed file.
//
// It reads packs, never writes, and never posts.
//
//   node scripts/check-announce.mjs            # check every pack
//   node scripts/check-announce.mjs --pack genesis
//
// Wired as `npm run check:announce`.
