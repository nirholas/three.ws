// Prove data/guards.json describes the guards this repo actually runs.
//
// Why this exists. The guard set is the only automated checkpoint here: there is
// no CI, so a check that is not wired into an unavoidable path (prebuild, the
// gate, the deploy chain, the pre-push hook) protects nothing. Two failure modes
// followed from that, and both had already happened when this was written:
//
//   1. Guards nobody could find. Eight working audit scripts sat in scripts/
//      with no npm script, discoverable only by reading the directory. One of
//      them said in its own header that it was "wired as npm run audit:console"
//      when no such script existed.
//   2. Documentation that claims a guard runs somewhere it does not. That is
//      worse than silence: a reader stops looking for the coverage they think
//      they already have.
//
// So this checks BOTH directions, and treats the stage column as a claim to be
// verified rather than prose:
//
//   a. Every registry entry names a script that exists and an npm script that
//      exists, so nothing in the registry is aspirational.
//   b. Every check-*/audit-* script on disk is registered, or matches an exempt
//      pattern that states WHY it is not a guard. New guards cannot land
//      undocumented.
//   c. Every `stages` claim is true against the real npm scripts: a guard
//      claiming "gate" must appear in the gate chain, "prebuild" in prebuild,
//      "build:gcp" in that chain, and "pre-push" in the installed hook template.
//      This is the check that keeps docs/guards.md and /guards honest, because
//      both render this file.
//
// Deliberately conservative: it never guesses that a script "looks like" a
// guard beyond the check-/audit- naming convention, because a checker that
// reports false positives gets switched off, which is worse than no check.
//
// Run: node scripts/audit-guards.mjs   (wired as `npm run audit:guards`)
