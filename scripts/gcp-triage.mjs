/**
 * gcp-triage: automated production monitor for the Cloud Run fleet.
 *
 * One command that answers "is production healthy, and if not, what exactly
 * do I do about it": pulls /api/healthz (the platform's own subsystem
 * roll-up), sweeps WARNING+ logs across every Cloud Run service, fingerprints
 * repeated signatures, matches them against the known-signature runbook
 * (docs/ops/production-log-triage.md), and emits a classified action plan.
 *
 *   npm run triage:gcp                 # human report, last hour
 *   npm run triage:gcp -- --since 6h   # wider window
 *   npm run triage:gcp -- --json       # machine-readable, for agents
 *   npm run triage:gcp:deep            # EVERYTHING: logs + version, TLS,
 *                                      # fleet, pages, crons, DB, wallets
 *
 * --deep layers nine read-only probes on top of the log sweep, each wrapping
 * an existing standalone audit, so one command answers "what's wrong with
 * three.ws?" across the whole surface instead of only what happened to log.
 * --skip <id,id> drops individual probes (ids in DEEP_PROBE_IDS below).
 *
 * Exit codes: 0 = healthy or self-healing noise only; 1 = findings that need
 * action; 2 = usage error. Agents: run with --json, then follow the fix
 * playbook in .agents/skills/gcp-triage/SKILL.md.

Only cause "rail" needs the log archaeology below. (1) npm run logs -- -s three-ws-api --app --grep "fee_wallet_below_floor" --since 1h; hits mean the sponsor fee wallet is under X402_SPONSOR_SOL_FLOOR_LAMPORTS. Config/self-heal territory: run POST /api/cron/treasury-topup (its reclaimIdleAgentSol leg refunds the fee wallet from idle agent SOL), no owner money needed unless every reclaim source reports at_or_below_floor.
