/**
 * Does a held SSE stream occupy a Cloud Run concurrency slot?
 *
 * This decides the stream cap, and it is not a detail: `containerConcurrency` is
 * 160 on three-ws-api, so if a stream holds a slot for its whole life then the
 * platform starts refusing requests long before an admission cap of several
 * hundred would ever fire, and the ladder would be decoration.
 *
 * It is measured rather than reasoned about, against the running service, using
 * a streaming endpoint already deployed there. Cloud Run publishes the observed
 * concurrency per instance as `container/max_request_concurrencies`, which is
 * the platform's own accounting of what it counts as an in-flight request. If
 * holding N streams moves that number, a stream is a concurrency slot; if it
 * does not, a stream is free and the cap can be sized on memory alone.
 *
 * Reading that metric rather than watching for a scaling event is deliberate:
 * forcing this service to autoscale would take more than a thousand concurrent
 * streams, which is a load test on production, and the concurrency gauge answers
 * the same question with two hundred.
 *
 * @param {{ url?: string, streams?: number, seconds?: number, project?: string, service?: string }} options
