// Install the repo's pre-push hook into .git/hooks.
//
// Why this exists: scripts/check-rules.mjs (the diff-scoped CLAUDE.md hard-rules
// guard) was enforced by nothing. It existed, it worked, and no mandatory path
// ran it, so violations shipped anyway. A guard that is not wired into an
// unavoidable path decays into documentation. The unavoidable path for
// commit-content rules is pre-push: it sees exactly the commits leaving the
// machine, after all local churn has settled.
//
// scripts/check-secrets.mjs rides the same path for the same reason, and with a
// sharper deadline: a credential that reaches a remote is copied by every clone
// and fork, so deleting the line later does not undo the leak. Pre-push is the
// last moment a block is still cheaper than a rotation.
//
// Design constraints, in order:
//   1. Scoped to the push. The hook runs both guards with --base <remote sha>
//      --head <local sha> per pushed ref, so they judge only the commits being
//      pushed. Concurrent agents' in-flight worktree edits are invisible to it.
//      This is why the hook does NOT run `npm run gate` or working-tree checks:
//      on a worktree shared by several agents those block your push on someone
//      else's red, and the owner's rule is that a requested push executes
//      immediately.
//   2. Fast. One node process per pushed ref, seconds not minutes.
//   3. Escapable. SKIP_PUSH_CHECKS=1 git push bypasses it for emergencies.
//   4. Composes with git-lfs. The stock LFS hook lived here first; ours replays
//      the refs on stdin to `git lfs pre-push` after the rules pass.
//
// Runs from postinstall, so every `npm install` (re)installs it. Safe to run
// anywhere: exits quietly when there is no git repo (tarball installs, CI).
//
// Usage: node scripts/setup-git-hooks.mjs
