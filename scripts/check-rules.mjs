// Enforce the CLAUDE.md hard rules on the lines you actually changed.
//
// The hard rules (no TODOs, no stubs, no fake data, no em-dashes) were enforced
// only by agent discipline, which means they were enforced unevenly. A
// repo-wide sweep is not an option: 5,985 tracked files already contain an
// em-dash, and rewriting them all would be a catastrophic diff that buries
// every real change for a month.
//
// So this guard is DIFF-SCOPED. It reads added lines only, which stops the
// bleeding without touching history: your change is held to the rules, the
// legacy around it is left alone until someone touches it deliberately. That
// makes the rules enforceable today instead of aspirational forever.
//
// Modes:
//   node scripts/check-rules.mjs              working tree + staged, vs HEAD
//   node scripts/check-rules.mjs --staged     staged only (pre-commit)
//   node scripts/check-rules.mjs --base <ref> everything since <ref> (branch review)
//   node scripts/check-rules.mjs --base <ref> --head <ref>   a pushed ref that is not HEAD (pre-push hook)
//   node scripts/check-rules.mjs --paths a.js b.js   only these files
//
// --paths matters here: concurrent agents share this worktree, so a bare
// `git diff HEAD` shows everyone's in-flight work, not yours. Scope to the
// files you touched and you get a verdict on YOUR change.
//
// In --base mode (the pre-push hook) it ALSO lints the subject line of every
// commit in base..head. History filled up with "chore: sync working tree"
// sweeps that say nothing about the diff they carry, which makes the log
// useless for archaeology. A subject must describe the change: banned generic
// subjects and sub-15-character subjects fail the push. Merge commits and the
// deliberately-neutral revert messages CLAUDE.md mandates are exempt.
//
// Exit 1 on any violation, with file:line and the rule broken.
