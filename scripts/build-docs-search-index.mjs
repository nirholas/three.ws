/**
 * Documentation search index builder.
 *
 * The site-wide Cmd-K palette (public/search.js) searches page titles, agents,
 * coins, and skills. It has never searched the documentation itself, so the
 * 450+ markdown files under docs/ were reachable only by knowing their name in
 * advance. Anyone who typed a real question ("how do I fund an agent wallet")
 * got nothing, and the answer was three clicks and a guess away.
 *
 * This builds a static, section-level inverted index over that corpus so the
 * browser can answer those queries locally: no search service, no server round
 * trip, no per-query cost, and it keeps working offline once cached.
 *
 * Design notes worth knowing before editing:
 *
 *   • Sections, not files. A hit on "settle floor" should land on the heading
 *     that discusses it, not the top of a 1,200-line reference. Anchors are
 *     produced with the SAME slug rules docs/index.html applies when it assigns
 *     heading ids, so every emitted anchor resolves in the reader.
 *   • Code fences are skipped. They are a large share of the corpus and their
 *     tokens (variable names, JSON keys, hex) drown prose in the ranking.
 *   • Postings are capped per term (MAX_POSTINGS). The index size is dominated
 *     by a few hundred very common terms; capping those costs almost nothing in
 *     ranking quality, because a query's rare terms are what select the section
 *     and the common terms only nudge the score.
 *   • Output is deterministic — no timestamps — so `--check` can compare the
 *     committed artifact byte-for-byte and fail when docs changed without a
 *     rebuild. A stale index is worse than none: it answers confidently and
 *     sends the reader to a heading that no longer exists.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/build-docs-search-index.mjs           # write the index
 *   node scripts/build-docs-search-index.mjs --check   # verify it is current
