## 1. Model Loading Issues

### The 3D model doesn't appear (blank canvas)

**Symptom:** The `<agent-3d>` element renders but the canvas is empty or stays on the loading poster.

**Likely causes:**
- Network error fetching the GLB
- CORS headers missing on the GLB host
- File too large for the browser to parse in time
- Wrong file format

**Fix steps:**

1. Open DevTools → Console (F12). Look for red errors — a failed fetch or a Three.js parse error will be logged there.
2. Open DevTools → Network. Find the GLB request. Check the HTTP status code:
   - `404` — the URL is wrong. Verify `src` attribute.
   - `403` / `401` — access is blocked. Make the file publicly readable.
   - `200` with a CORS error in Console — see the CORS section below.
3. Paste the GLB URL directly into a new browser tab. If it downloads or previews, the URL is valid.
4. Check file size. Models over ~100 MB can cause timeouts on slow connections. Compress with Draco (5–10× mesh size reduction). See "Model loads slowly" under Performance.
5. Verify the format. Only **glTF 2.0** (`.glb` or `.gltf`) is supported. glTF 1.0, OBJ, FBX, and USDZ are not. If you're exporting from Blender, use File → Export → glTF 2.0 with "Format: GLB".

---

### "CORS error" in the console

**Symptom:** Console shows `Access to fetch at '...' has been blocked by CORS policy`.

**Likely causes:**
- The server hosting the GLB doesn't send CORS response headers.

**Fix steps:**

1. Add `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` to the response headers on the server that hosts your GLB. How to do this depends on your host:
   - **Nginx:** `add_header Access-Control-Allow-Origin *;` in the `location` block.
   - **Apache:** `Header set Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*"` in `.htaccess`.
   - **AWS S3 / CloudFront:** Set a CORS policy on the bucket (allow all origins, GET method).
   - **Vercel / Netlify:** Add a `headers` rule in the config file.
2. If you can't modify the server, use the `key-proxy` attribute on `<agent-3d>` to route the fetch through a proxy that adds CORS headers:
   ```html
   <agent-3d src="https://cdn.example.com/model.glb"
             key-proxy="https://your-cors-proxy/proxy?url="></agent-3d>
   ```

### Model loads but textures are missing

**Symptom:** The model's geometry appears but surfaces are grey or untextured.

**Likely causes:**
- For `.gltf` (JSON format): texture files aren't being served alongside the JSON file
- Texture URLs inside the glTF JSON are broken

**Fix steps:**

1. Open the file in a glTF viewer (e.g. [gltf.report](https://gltf.report)) to isolate the problem from the viewer itself.
2. If using `.gltf` (not `.glb`): texture PNG/JPG files must be served from the same origin as the JSON and referenced by relative path. The simplest fix is to re-export as `.glb` — this embeds all textures in one file.
3. If using `.glb`: textures are embedded by default. If they're missing, the export settings may have excluded them. In Blender: tick "Include → Textures" when exporting.

---

### Model loads but looks wrong (black material, wrong colors)

**Symptom:** Model appears but with black surfaces, missing reflections, or washed-out colors.

**Likely causes:**
- No environment map — metallic materials need a reflection source
- Metalness = 1.0 with no environment (renders black)
- Inverted normal map

**Fix steps:**

1. Change the environment preset in the viewer panel. Metallic materials need an HDR environment to reflect.
2. If the model is all-black: open it in Blender and check the material's Metallic value. A fully metallic material with no environment will be pitch black. Set Metallic to 0 or load an HDRI in the viewer.
3. If lighting looks inverted: the normal map's G channel may be flipped (a common difference between DirectX and OpenGL conventions). Flip it in your 3D editor before re-exporting.

---

### Draco-compressed model fails to load

**Symptom:** Model exported with Draco compression either shows an error or silently fails to load.

**Likely causes:**
- Content Security Policy blocking the Draco decoder WASM (loaded from CDN)

**Fix steps:**

1. Check the Console for CSP violations mentioning `draco_decoder.wasm` or the CDN hostname.
2. If CSP is blocking it, either add the CDN to your `script-src` and `connect-src` directives, or host the decoder yourself and set `dracoDecoderPath` on the viewer options.

---

## 2. Agent / LLM Issues

### Agent doesn't respond to messages

**Symptom:** Chat input works but no reply appears. The agent is silent.

**Likely causes:**
- `brain` attribute not set on `<agent-3d>` — without it, the element uses `NullProvider` (a no-op)
- Missing or invalid `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- Rate limit reached

**Fix steps:**

1. Check the `brain` attribute. The agent only activates LLM mode when `brain` is set to a model name:
   ```html
   <agent-3d brain="claude-opus-4-6" ...></agent-3d>
   ```
   Without this attribute, `brain.provider` defaults to `none` and the agent uses `NullProvider`, which returns empty responses silently.
2. Open DevTools → Network. Filter for `/api/chat` or `/api/llm`. Look at the response:
   - `401` — the API key is missing or invalid.
   - `429` — rate limited. Wait a minute and retry.
   - `500` — server error. Check the server logs.
3. Verify `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set in your environment. In Vercel: Settings → Environment Variables. The key must be present before deployment — a new deploy is required after adding it.
4. If you're calling the Anthropic API directly from the browser (not via a proxy), also set the `api-key` attribute on the element and note that this exposes your key to users.

---

### Agent responds but says something off-topic

**Symptom:** The agent replies but ignores its role or answers questions it shouldn't.

**Fix steps:**

1. Tighten the system prompt. A vague `instructions` field produces vague behavior. Be explicit: "You are a guide for [product]. You only discuss [topic]. If asked about anything else, say you can't help with that."
2. Add a boundary statement to the instructions: "Never break character. Never discuss topics outside [domain]."
3. If you're loading instructions from a `.md` file via `brain.instructions`, verify the file is being fetched correctly — check the Network panel for the `.md` request.

---

### Agent emotions not showing (no facial expression)

**Symptom:** Agent responds and speaks but the avatar's face doesn't change expression.

**Likely causes:**
- Model missing required morph targets
- Missing `Head` or `Neck` bone for head movement

**Fix steps:**

1. Check the Console. The avatar module logs a warning if expected morph targets aren't found on load.
2. Verify your GLB has morph targets named exactly as expected (case-sensitive). The emotion system maps to: `mouthSmile`, `mouthFrown`, `mouthOpen`, `cheekPuff`, `browInnerUp`, `browOuterUp`, `noseSneer`, `eyeSquint`, `eyesClosed`. These are the standard Ready Player Me / VRM names.
3. For head tilt and lean, the skeleton needs a `Head` or `Neck` bone. Open the model in Blender and check the armature.
4. Confirm the avatar module is initialized: open DevTools Console and run `window.VIEWER?.agent_avatar`. If `undefined`, the avatar layer didn't boot — check for earlier errors in the console.

---

### Agent speaks but mouth doesn't move

**Symptom:** TTS audio plays but lips stay still.

**Likely cause:** The `mouthOpen` morph target is missing or misspelled.

**Fix steps:**

1. Open the GLB in Blender → Object Data Properties → Shape Keys. Look for `mouthOpen` (exact spelling, camelCase).
2. If the shape key exists but has a different name (e.g. `Mouth_Open`, `mouth_open`), rename it to `mouthOpen` and re-export.

---

### TTS not working (agent doesn't speak aloud)

**Symptom:** Agent sends text responses but no audio.

**Likely causes:**
- Browser blocking audio autoplay
- Browser doesn't support `SpeechSynthesis`

**Fix steps:**

1. Click somewhere on the page first. Browsers block audio autoplay until there's been a user interaction. After clicking, retry the message.
2. Check browser support: run `'speechSynthesis' in window` in the Console. If `false`, the browser doesn't support the Web Speech API. Try Chrome or Edge.
3. Check system volume and browser tab mute state.

---

### ElevenLabs TTS not working

**Symptom:** ElevenLabs voice is configured but no audio plays, or audio falls back to browser TTS.

**Fix steps:**

1. Open DevTools → Network. Filter for `/api/tts` or `elevenlabs.io`. Check the response:
   - `401` — `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` is missing or wrong.
   - `429` — rate limited. The free tier allows 10,000 characters/month.
   - `422` — voice ID is invalid. Verify the `voiceId` in your manifest or config.
2. Confirm `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` is set in your server environment variables.

---

## 3. Embedding Issues

### Embedded agent doesn't appear

**Symptom:** The page loads but the `<agent-3d>` element is invisible.

**Likely causes:**
- Script tag not loaded before the element
- CSP blocking the CDN
- SSR rendering the web component on the server (which has no `window`)

**Fix steps:**

1. Verify the `<script>` tag loads before the `<agent-3d>` element in the DOM, or that it uses `defer`/`async` correctly.
2. Check the Console for CSP violations. The CDN origin (`cdn.three.ws`) must appear in your `script-src` policy.
3. For **Next.js**: web components use browser APIs (`window`, `document`, `SpeechSynthesis`) that don't exist server-side. Mark the component file with `'use client'` and disable SSR for the wrapper:
   ```js
   import dynamic from 'next/dynamic';
   const Agent3D = dynamic(() => import('./Agent3DWrapper'), { ssr: false });
   ```

---

### Iframe embed shows "Refused to connect" or blocked by X-Frame-Options

**Symptom:** An iframe pointing at the agent URL shows an error instead of the agent.

**Fix steps:**

1. Verify the `src` URL is correct — use the full HTTPS URL.
2. Do not use a URL that ends in `/edit` or `/dashboard` — those pages block framing for security. Use the agent's public embed URL.
3. Note: the `frame-ancestors` CSP for the embed is currently set via a `<meta>` HTTP-equiv tag, which browsers ignore for `frame-ancestors` (it must be an HTTP header). This means any origin can embed — if you're seeing a block, it's coming from something else, likely the host page's own CSP or an extension.

---

### postMessage not working

**Symptom:** Messages sent to the agent iframe via `postMessage` don't produce a reaction.

**Fix steps:**

1. Target the correct origin: `'https://three.ws/'` (or your self-hosted origin).
2. Listen for `message` events on `window`, not on the iframe element itself:
   ```js
   window.addEventListener('message', (e) => {
     if (e.origin !== 'https://three.ws/') return;
     console.log(e.data);
   });
   ```
3. All messages use the `'3dagent:'` type prefix. Outbound messages should look like `{ type: '3dagent:speak', payload: { text: '...' } }`.
4. Use the embed-host bridge (`src/embed-host-bridge.js`) rather than raw `postMessage` — it handles the ping/pong handshake and waits for the iframe to be ready.

---

### Floating agent hidden behind other elements

**Symptom:** `mode="floating"` agent is clipped or hidden behind page content.

**Fix steps:**

1. The element sets `z-index: 2147483000` internally via `:host([mode="floating"])`. If another element has a higher z-index, it will cover the agent.
2. Check parent elements for `overflow: hidden` — this can clip absolutely-positioned children even with a high z-index.
3. If the agent is inside a stacking context (e.g. a `position: relative` container with `z-index`), the z-index is relative to that context. Move `<agent-3d>` to a direct child of `<body>` if possible.

---

### Agent looks tiny or invisible on mobile

**Symptom:** The agent element exists in the DOM but renders as a 0×0 or very small box.

**Likely cause:** No explicit dimensions set. The web component has no intrinsic size.

**Fix steps:**

1. Set explicit dimensions. A good mobile starting point:
   ```html
   <agent-3d style="width: 100%; height: 50vh;" ...></agent-3d>
   ```
2. Avoid `display: inline` on the container — use `block` or `flex`.
3. For inline mode with automatic aspect ratio, add the `responsive` attribute:
   ```html
   <agent-3d responsive style="width: 100%;" ...></agent-3d>
   ```
   This sets `aspect-ratio: 3/4` and lets height follow width.

---

## 4. Authentication Issues

### Can't connect wallet

**Symptom:** "Connect Wallet" button does nothing or shows an error.

**Fix steps:**

1. MetaMask: confirm the extension is installed, unlocked, and the correct account is selected.
2. WalletConnect: QR codes expire after ~60 seconds. Refresh the page and try again.
3. Confirm you're on the correct network. Some operations require switching to Base (chain ID 8453) or Base Sepolia (chain ID 84532 for testnet).
4. Incognito / private mode: MetaMask may not inject `window.ethereum` in private windows. Try a normal window.

---

### "invalid_domain" error during wallet sign-in

**Symptom:** After signing the SIWE message, the server returns a 400 `invalid_domain` error.

**Likely cause:** The `PUBLIC_APP_ORIGIN` environment variable doesn't match the domain in the browser URL bar.

**Fix steps:**

1. Set `PUBLIC_APP_ORIGIN` to exactly the origin users are hitting (e.g. `https://www.yourdomain.com`). `www.yourdomain.com` and `yourdomain.com` are treated as different domains.
2. For local development, any `localhost` domain is accepted automatically — you don't need to set `PUBLIC_APP_ORIGIN` for local dev.
3. For Vercel preview deployments, `VERCEL_URL` is automatically trusted alongside `PUBLIC_APP_ORIGIN`.

---

### Session expires unexpectedly

**Symptom:** Users are logged out before the 7-day session window.

**Likely cause:** `JWT_SECRET` changed between deploys, which invalidates all existing sessions.

**Fix steps:**

1. Set `JWT_SECRET` once and don't rotate it unless needed. Store it in Vercel's environment variable settings — it must be the same value across all deployments.
2. Session duration is 7 days and is not currently configurable.

---

### API key authentication fails

**Symptom:** Requests using an API key return 401 or 403.

**Fix steps:**

1. The key must be sent as `Authorization: Bearer <key>` — include the `Bearer ` prefix with a space.
2. Check if the key has been revoked in the dashboard (Settings → API Keys).
3. Verify the key's scope includes the endpoint you're calling. For example, reading avatar data requires `avatars:read`; creating or updating requires `avatars:write`.

---

## 5. Blockchain / ERC-8004 Issues

### Transaction reverts during registration

**Symptom:** The on-chain registration transaction fails with a revert error.

**Fix steps:**

1. Increase the gas limit by 20% — registration involves IPFS CID storage and can exceed estimates.
2. Check your ETH balance on Base. Bridge more if needed.
3. Verify the manifest CID resolves on IPFS before calling the contract. A CID that doesn't resolve yet may cause the contract to reject it depending on the registry version.
4. Confirm MetaMask is on Base mainnet (chain ID 8453), not Ethereum mainnet. The registry is not deployed on mainnet.

---

### "IPFS pinning failed" during registration

**Symptom:** The upload step fails with a pinning error before the transaction is even sent.

**Fix steps:**

1. Retry — IPFS providers go down occasionally. Wait a minute and try again.
2. Check `PINATA_JWT` (or your configured IPFS provider key) in your environment variables.
3. The default backend uses R2 storage (via `/api/erc8004/pin`). If you're supplying a Pinata JWT directly to the client, verify the token is valid and not expired in the Pinata dashboard.

---

### Agent doesn't appear on the discover/explore page after registration

**Symptom:** Transaction confirmed but the agent isn't visible on the on-chain listing.

**Fix steps:**

1. Wait 1–2 minutes. The indexer polls the chain periodically.
2. Access the agent directly by URL: `https://three.ws/a/<chainId>/<agentId>` — this bypasses the index.
3. Confirm the transaction was actually confirmed (not just submitted) on the block explorer for Base.

---

### ENS resolution not working

**Symptom:** Navigating to `/agent/ens/yourname.eth` shows "not found".

**Fix steps:**

1. Verify the `3dagent` text record is set on the ENS name. In the ENS manager, add a text record with key `3dagent` and value set to your agent's on-chain ID.
2. ENS records can take 30+ minutes to propagate after being set.
3. Test direct resolution: `https://three.ws/agent/ens/yourname.eth`

---

## 6. Memory Issues

### Agent forgets everything on reload

**Symptom:** The agent starts fresh with no memory of previous conversations.

**Likely causes:**
- Memory mode is `"none"` — conversations are never persisted
- localStorage was cleared

**Fix steps:**

1. Check the `memory` attribute or manifest setting. The default mode is `"local"` (persisted to `localStorage`). If your manifest or element sets `memory="none"`, memory is intentionally disabled.
2. Verify `localStorage` isn't being cleared. Open DevTools → Application → Local Storage and look for keys starting with `3dagent:`. If they're missing after a conversation, check if your browser settings clear storage on close.
3. Private/incognito mode: `localStorage` is cleared when the window closes. This is browser behavior, not a bug.

---

### IPFS memory not loading on another device

**Symptom:** A user's memory is stored but doesn't appear when they sign in on a different device.

**Cause:** The IPFS CID pointer is stored in `localStorage`, which doesn't sync between devices.

**Fix:** Cross-device memory sync is not implemented in the current release. It requires a server-side memory backend. Stay tuned for an upcoming release that adds this. For now, each device maintains its own local memory.

---

## 7. Performance Issues

### Model loads slowly

**Symptom:** The model takes many seconds to appear, or shows a long loading spinner.

**Fix steps:**

1. Check file size. Over 10 MB is noticeable on mobile; over 50 MB is slow on most connections.
2. Enable Draco compression on export. In Blender's glTF exporter: Geometry → Compression → enable. This typically reduces mesh data by 5–10×.
3. Scale down textures. 4096×4096 textures are rarely necessary — 1024×1024 is fine for most avatars. Use KTX2 format for GPU-compressed textures that decompress on the GPU rather than in JavaScript.
4. Merge meshes in Blender before exporting. Fewer objects = fewer draw calls = faster load.

---

### Low FPS / choppy animation

**Symptom:** Frame rate is visibly low or the animation stutters.

**Fix steps:**

1. Open the stats panel (visible in the dat.gui panel on the right side of the viewer). Check which metric is the bottleneck — GPU time or JavaScript time.
2. Reduce polygon count. Under 100k triangles renders at 60fps on most desktop GPUs; under 50k for mobile.
3. Disable environment maps on mobile — IBL (image-based lighting) is GPU-expensive. Set `preset="none"` or use a simple directional light preset.
4. Limit the number of `<agent-3d>` elements on a single page. Each one creates a WebGL context. Most browsers cap WebGL contexts at 8–16; 4–6 is a safe limit, fewer on mobile.

---

### Page freezes when loading a large model

**Symptom:** The browser UI freezes for several seconds while the model loads.

**Cause:** GLB parsing runs on the main thread. Models over ~50 MB can cause noticeable jank.

**Fix steps:**

1. Compress with Draco — the WASM decoder is more efficient and has less UI thread impact than uncompressed mesh parsing.
2. Split the model into multiple smaller files if possible, and load non-essential parts after the main avatar appears.
3. Moving model loading to a Web Worker is technically possible but requires custom viewer configuration — advanced use case.

---

## 8. Self-Hosting Issues

### "Cannot connect to database" on startup

**Symptom:** Server throws on startup or API routes return 500 with a database connection error.

**Fix steps:**

1. Verify `DATABASE_URL` is set. The format for Neon is: `postgres://user:password@host/dbname?sslmode=require`.
2. If using Neon: check that your server's IP is in the Neon project's IP allowlist (or set it to allow all IPs during development).
3. Run the schema migration to ensure tables exist:
   ```bash
   node scripts/apply-schema.mjs
   ```

---

### API routes return 500

**Symptom:** Requests to `/api/*` return HTTP 500 with no useful body.

**Fix steps:**

1. Check Vercel function logs: `vercel logs --follow` in the project directory.
2. The most common cause is a missing environment variable. All required vars must be set: `DATABASE_URL`, `JWT_SECRET`, `PUBLIC_APP_ORIGIN`. The `env.js` module throws on startup if required vars are absent.

---

### PWA / service worker serves stale assets after deploy

**Symptom:** After deploying a new version, some users still see the old UI.

**Fix steps:**

1. Hard-refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac).
2. Clear the service worker manually: DevTools → Application → Service Workers → "Unregister", then DevTools → Application → Clear Storage → "Clear site data".
3. Service workers cache aggressively and can serve stale content for up to 24 hours. This is expected behavior — users will update automatically when the SW checks for a new version.

---

## FAQ

**Is three.ws free?**

The core platform is free. API usage costs (Anthropic for LLM, ElevenLabs for TTS) are charged at cost — you supply your own API keys. IPFS pinning for on-chain registration requires a Pinata JWT or uses the default R2 backend.

**Can I use any 3D model, or does it have to be a humanoid?**

Any glTF 2.0 / GLB model works. Humanoid models with the correct skeleton and morph targets unlock the full emotion system (facial expressions, head movement). Non-humanoid models display and animate fine — they just won't show emotions.

**Does the agent work without an Anthropic API key?**

The 3D viewer, animations, and widget system all work without a key. The LLM conversation feature requires setting the `brain` attribute on the element and a valid API key. If no key is configured, the element uses `NullProvider` (no-op) — it won't respond to chat messages.

**Can I self-host without Vercel?**

Yes. The API routes are standard Node.js async functions — any Node.js host works. You'll need to replicate Vercel's `vercel.json` rewrite rules in your host's routing config (Express routes, Nginx `proxy_pass`, etc.).

**Is the agent data private?**

In local memory mode, all conversation memory stays in the browser's `localStorage`. Conversation messages are sent to the Anthropic API (subject to [Anthropic's privacy policy](https://www.anthropic.com/privacy)). Model files are never uploaded unless you explicitly save to your account. If you're building a sensitive application, review what data flows through each API.

**The `IdleAnimation` (blink / head-drift) doesn't seem to work.**

This is a known open issue. The `IdleAnimation` class is implemented in `src/idle-animation.js` but is not yet wired into the avatar system — it's imported but the integration with `agent-avatar.js` is incomplete. Idle blink and head-drift are not active in the current release. This is tracked as a defect.
