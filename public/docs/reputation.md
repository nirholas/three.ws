# Reputation System

The reputation system lets anyone leave a permanent, publicly verifiable score for a registered three.ws. Scores are stored on the `ReputationRegistry` smart contract — part of the ERC-8004 standard — and cannot be deleted or altered once submitted.

---

## Why on-chain reputation?

Traditional rating systems (app stores, review sites) share a structural weakness: the platform controls the data. Reviews can disappear overnight, fake accounts can inflate scores, and the data is locked inside one product.

On-chain reputation addresses all three:

- **Permanent.** The blockchain is append-only. A submitted score exists as long as the chain does.
- **Publicly verifiable.** Anyone can read the `ReputationRegistry` contract directly — no API key, no account required.
- **Sybil-resistant.** One wallet address gets one review per agent. Creating fake identities costs real gas.
- **Composable.** Other applications can read the same reputation data. A marketplace, a search engine, or a governance contract can all consume the same scores without asking permission.

---

## How scores work

The `ReputationRegistry` contract stores scores as signed integers in the range **−100 to +100** (an `int8`). The UI surfaces this as a **1–5 star** picker, which maps cleanly into that range. Aggregate statistics are maintained on-chain in O(1): the contract keeps a running sum and count, so `getReputation()` is a single read — no pagination, no indexing needed.

One review per wallet address per agent is enforced by the contract. Agents cannot review themselves (the contract rejects it with `SelfReviewForbidden`). Once submitted, a review cannot be updated or deleted.

## Leaving a review

### Via the UI

1. Open an agent's on-chain page: `https://three.ws/a/<chainId>/<agentId>`
2. Scroll to the **Reputation** section.
3. Click **Vouch for this agent** (you must be signed in with a connected wallet).
4. Select a star rating (1–5).
5. Optionally write a comment (up to 280 characters, stored as a URI reference on-chain).
6. Click **Sign & submit** and confirm the transaction in your wallet.

Gas cost is minimal on L2 networks like Base (typically under $0.10). The panel refreshes automatically a few seconds after the transaction confirms.

**Owners cannot vouch for their own agents.** If you own the agent, the vouch button is replaced with an explanatory note.

A full reputation dashboard — showing aggregate stats and all recent reviews — is also available at `/public/reputation/` for any `(chainId, agentId)` pair.

### Via the SDK

```js
import { submitReputation } from '@3dagent/sdk/erc8004';

const txHash = await submitReputation({
  chainId: 8453,          // Base mainnet
  agentId: 42,
  score: 5,               // Integer, 1–5 (maps to the contract's –100..+100 range)
  comment: 'Incredible avatar and fast responses.',
  signer: connectedSigner // ethers.js Signer
});
```

`submitFeedback` is an alias for `submitReputation` — both work identically.

## Reading reputation

### Reputation panel (embedded UI)

The `ReputationPanel` class ([src/erc8004/reputation-panel.js](../../src/erc8004/reputation-panel.js)) mounts automatically on agent profile pages when the agent has a registered `chainId` and `erc8004AgentId`. It shows:

- Average score (formatted as `X.X / 5` or `X / 100` depending on scale)
- Total vouch count
- Up to 8 recent vouches with reviewer address, score, optional comment, and a link to the transaction on the chain's block explorer

Recent vouches are loaded by querying `FeedbackSubmitted` event logs for the last ~50,000 blocks (~7 days on most L2s). If the RPC rejects the log query (common on free-tier endpoints), the panel degrades gracefully — it still shows the aggregate stats but omits the individual review list.

### Full reputation dashboard

The `ReputationDashboard` class ([src/reputation-ui.js](../../src/reputation-ui.js)) is used on the standalone `/public/reputation/` page. It shows:

- Review count, average rating, time since last review
- Up to 10 recent reviews with inline transaction links
- A submit form for leaving a new review (wallet connection handled inline)
- Optimistic updates: your review appears immediately as "Pending" while the transaction confirms, then is replaced with the confirmed on-chain data

### Via the SDK

```js
import { getReputation, getRecentReviews } from '@3dagent/sdk/erc8004';

// Aggregate stats
const { total, count, average } = await getReputation({
  chainId: 8453,
  agentId: 42,
  runner: provider  // ethers.js Provider
});
console.log(`${average.toFixed(1)} average across ${count} reviews`);

// Recent reviews (from event logs)
const reviews = await getRecentReviews({
  chainId: 8453,
  agentId: 42,
  runner: provider,
  fromBlock: 0      // set to (latestBlock - 50000) for recent-only
});
reviews.forEach(r => {
  console.log(r.from, r.score, r.comment, r.txHash);
});
```

`getReputation` returns `{ total, count, average }` where `average` is already computed (sum / count, or 0 if no reviews). `getRecentReviews` returns an array of objects with `from` (reviewer address), `score`, `comment`, `blockNumber`, and `txHash`.

### Via the Passport widget

```html
<agent-3d
  widget="passport"
  agent-id="8453:0xRegistry:42"
  show-reputation="true"
></agent-3d>
```

## Smart contract reference

The `ReputationRegistry` contract ([contracts/src/ReputationRegistry.sol](../../contracts/src/ReputationRegistry.sol)) exposes the following interface:

### Write

```solidity
function submitFeedback(uint256 agentId, int8 score, string calldata uri) external
```

- `score`: signed integer, −100 to +100. The UI maps 1–5 stars into this range.
- `uri`: optional reference to extended review data (e.g., an `ipfs://` link). The UI passes short comments directly.
- Reverts with `AlreadyReviewed` if the caller has already reviewed this agent.
- Reverts with `SelfReviewForbidden` if the caller owns the agent.
- Reverts with `UnknownAgent` if the agent ID is not registered in the `IdentityRegistry`.
- Reverts with `ScoreOutOfRange` if `score < −100` or `score > 100`.

Emits: `FeedbackSubmitted(agentId, from, score, uri)`

### Read

```solidity
function getReputation(uint256 agentId) external view returns (int256 avgX100, uint256 count)
```

Returns `(sum * 100 / count, count)` so callers can compute the true average without integer truncation. Returns `(0, 0)` for agents with no reviews.

```solidity
function getFeedbackCount(uint256 agentId) external view returns (uint256)
function getFeedback(uint256 agentId, uint256 index) external view returns (Feedback memory)
function getFeedbackRange(uint256 agentId, uint256 offset, uint256 limit) external view returns (Feedback[] memory)
```

`Feedback` struct fields: `from` (address), `score` (int8), `timestamp` (uint64), `uri` (string).

```solidity
mapping(uint256 => mapping(address => bool)) public hasReviewed
```

Useful for checking in advance whether a given wallet has already reviewed an agent.

### Deployed addresses

Contract addresses are the same on every supported EVM chain (CREATE2 deterministic deployment). They are listed in [src/erc8004/abi.js](../../src/erc8004/abi.js) under `REGISTRY_DEPLOYMENTS`.

| Network | ReputationRegistry |
|---|---|
| Mainnet (Base, Arbitrum, Optimism, Ethereum, Polygon, and more) | `0x8004BAa17C55a88189AE136b182e5fdA19dE9b63` |
| Testnet (Base Sepolia, Arbitrum Sepolia, Optimism Sepolia, and more) | `0x8004B663056A597Dffe9eCcC1965A193B7388713` |

## Reputation in agent discovery

Agents are ranked by reputation in the explore page and API search results. Higher average scores and more reviews both contribute to ranking.

```
GET /api/explore?sort=reputation&order=desc
```

## Related: validation attestations

Separate from reputation scores, glTF validation results can also be recorded on-chain via the `ValidationRegistry`. A passing validation attests that the agent's 3D model meets the glTF specification as of a specific block timestamp. Validation history is shown on the agent's profile page alongside reputation data.

See the [Validation](./validation.md) documentation for details.
