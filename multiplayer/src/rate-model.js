// Rate model for the /play coin worlds: the exact expected value of every action
// the world offers, in closed form.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
// Every yield rule in this game is already a pure function of skill level and node
// tuning (`gatherChance`, `gatherDoubleChance`, `coalBonusChance`, `cookBurnChance`,
// `fishCatchChance`, `fishDoubleChance` in items.js), and every cadence is a
// constant (`ACTIVITY_COOLDOWN_MS` in activities.js). That combination means the
// expected units, cash and XP per hour for any activity at any level are not a
// thing you have to measure by grinding. They are computable exactly, in one pass,
// with no simulation and no sampling error.
//
// This module does that computation. It imports the same tables the authoritative
// server rolls against and never restates a number, so the model cannot drift away
// from the game: change a price in shop.js or a curve in items.js and every rate
// below moves with it on the next request.
//
// EXACTNESS
// Where the game's XP award wraps a uniform integer roll in Math.round, the naive
// expectation (substituting the mean of the roll) is wrong, because rounding is not
// linear. Every expectation here sums over the roll's actual support instead, so the
// XP numbers are exact rather than approximately right. `tests/rate-model.test.js`
// pins that claim by replaying the real handler arithmetic under a seeded RNG and
// checking the closed form falls inside the sampling interval.
//
// SCOPE
// Pure functions over static tables. No room, no profile, no network, no clock. The
// only modelling assumptions are stated in ASSUMPTIONS below and surfaced verbatim
// through /api/play/solver, because a rate quoted without its assumptions is a lie.
