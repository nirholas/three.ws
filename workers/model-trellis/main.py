"""
TRELLIS inference service — single-image to textured 3D mesh via structured
latent representations (Microsoft, MIT license).

API contract (consumed by the Pipeline Controller):
  POST /infer   { images: [data-uri|url, ...], body_type?: str, job_id?: str,
                  seed?: int, quality?: {…}, tier?: str, matte?: bool,
                  rembg_model?: str }
             →  202 { task_id, status: "queued" }

  Multiple images are FUSED as multi-view conditioning of one asset
  (TrellisImageTo3DPipeline.run_multi_image): send turnaround views
  (front/side/back) of the same subject, not unrelated photos.

  tier selects a named quality preset (draft | standard | high | max); an
  explicit `quality` dict still overrides individual fields on top. matte runs
  the subject through the sibling rembg-service first (defaults on for tier=max)
  so the background stops bleeding into the mesh. Both are additive: with no
  tier and no matte the behaviour is byte-for-byte the historical default.

  GET  /tasks/:id → { task_id, status, result_gcs_url?, tier?, matted_views?,
                      quality?, error? }

  GET  /health    → { ok, model, gpu_available, tiers, rembg_matte, load_error,
                      load_attempts }. Answers 503 with ok:false once the model
                      load has spent its retry budget, so a permanently dead
                      instance is drained by the platform health report and
                      recycled by the Cloud Run liveness probe instead of
                      staying resident and failing every job it accepts.

  GET  /          → { service, model, ready, endpoints }. Unauthenticated
                    service descriptor for the platform's warmth probe.

Model weights pre-population:
  pip install huggingface_hub
  huggingface-cli download microsoft/TRELLIS-image-large --local-dir /tmp/trellis-large
  gsutil -m cp -r /tmp/trellis-large gs://three-ws-model-weights/trellis-large/

Environment variables (README.md carries the full table):
  API_KEY               shared bearer secret
  GCS_BUCKET            Cloud Storage bucket for output meshes
  WEIGHTS_DIR           local path to weights (default: /weights/trellis-large)
  WEIGHTS_GCS_URI       optional gs:// tree staged to local disk at startup
  WEIGHTS_LOCAL_DIR     where that staging lands (default: /tmp/trellis-weights)
  MAX_CONCURRENT        max parallel inferences (default: 1)
  REMBG_SERVICE_URL     sibling rembg worker for the matte pre-step
  REMBG_MODEL           default rembg model (default: isnet-general-use)
  REMBG_TIMEOUT_S       matte round-trip budget (default: 90)
  IMAGE_FETCH_TIMEOUT_S per-attempt image fetch timeout (default: 30)
  MODEL_LOAD_ATTEMPTS   model-load attempts before the error latches (default: 4)
  MODEL_LOAD_RETRY_BASE_S  first load-retry backoff, doubling (default: 15)
  MODEL_LOAD_RETRY_CAP_S   ceiling on that backoff (default: 120)
  DINOV2_LOCAL_DIR      baked dinov2 checkout for the image conditioner
                        (default: /opt/dinov2), so the load never calls GitHub
