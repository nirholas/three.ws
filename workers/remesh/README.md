# remesh — mesh processing (remesh · simplify · repair · convert)

Cleans up and re-topologizes a 3D file, or converts it between formats. Given a
mesh URL it can decimate the triangle count, generate quad-dominant topology,
bake a silhouette-preserving low-poly, repair holes and bad normals, or just
transcode between GLB / OBJ / FBX / STL / PLY / USDZ / 3MF. It backs three.ws's
post-generation tools — Game-Ready export and the remesh stage of the paid 3D
asset pipeline — not the primary generation lanes.

Wraps `trimesh` + `open3d` for geometry, [QuadriFlow](https://github.com/hjwdzh/QuadriFlow)
(MIT) for quad remeshing, [xatlas](https://github.com/jpcy/xatlas) (MIT) for UV
re-unwrap, and headless [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) (`bpy`) for FBX
import and export. **No GPU required**: everything runs on CPU.

A FastAPI service on Cloud Run. Jobs are accepted immediately (`202`) and polled
— a quad remesh with texture re-bake runs far longer than a request should be
held open.

## Why Blender for FBX

FBX is the only format here that needs Blender: `trimesh` has neither an FBX
writer nor an FBX reader (it answers `File type: fbx not supported`). So FBX
goes through a one-shot headless Blender subprocess (`blender_fbx.py`) in both
directions:

- **FBX output** is bridged through a temporary GLB that Blender exports as FBX.
- **FBX input** is imported by Blender and written out as a GLB before any
  trimesh pipeline sees it, so every mode and operation accepts a binary FBX.
  The worker recognises FBX by its bytes (`Kaydara FBX Binary` magic) as well as
  by the URL, so a signed or extensionless URL works too. Blender's importer
  reads binary FBX 7.1 and later only; an ASCII FBX (`; FBX` header), a corrupt
  file, or one with no mesh polygons fails the task with `error_kind: "input"`
  and a message that says what to re-export, never an opaque internal error.

DAE input needs no Blender: trimesh reads it through `pycollada`, which
`trimesh[easy]` installs. The image carries no assimp library at all; nothing
in the worker loads it.

USDZ has no trimesh writer either, but it needs no Blender: it is authored directly on a USD stage with `pxr` (`_write_usdz` in
[`main.py`](./main.py)). Every other format trimesh writes itself.

That Blender subprocess exits without running interpreter finalization, and the
worker judges it by the `FACE_COUNT:` marker it prints rather than by its exit
status. Tearing `bpy` down after a scene has been loaded segfaults in this
container: the FBX is written in full, then the process dies during Blender's own
shutdown. Reading that as a failed export is what made every `output_format:
"fbx"` request fail until 2026-08-11.

A plain `convert` of a **rigged** GLB to FBX keeps its bone hierarchy, skin
weights, and blendshapes. That route (`remesh_mode: "triangle"`,
`operation: "convert"`, `output_format: "fbx"`) skips the geometry pipelines
entirely so the skeleton survives. Any geometry-changing op discards the rig and
yields a static FBX.

## Modes

| `remesh_mode` | What it does |
|---|---|
| `triangle` (default) | Repair + quadric-error triangle decimation (open3d, trimesh fallback). Geometry only — drops materials. Honors `operation`. |
| `quad` | Field-aligned quad-dominant topology via QuadriFlow, then xatlas UV re-unwrap + source-texture re-bake. Reports a real `quad_ratio`. An open or non-manifold input is cleaned and rebuilt watertight first (see below); QuadriFlow refuses anything else. |
| `lowpoly` | Silhouette-preserving QEM decimation + UV re-unwrap + texture re-bake. |

`operation` (`convert` · `simplify` · `repair` · `full`) applies to `triangle`
mode; `full` (default) runs repair then decimate.

### What quad mode does to your mesh before QuadriFlow

QuadriFlow needs a watertight manifold, and no real character export is one:
they are assembled from overlapping parts, so seams share edges between more
than two faces, and they are open at the wrists, neck, and hems. Fed such a mesh
QuadriFlow aborts in its index-map solve with `wrong init`, whichever flow solver
it is given. Quad mode therefore runs three preparation steps, each of which
falls through rather than failing the job:

1. `_repair_mesh` fills holes, drops degenerate faces, and merges vertices.
2. `_make_manifold` removes duplicate and non-manifold geometry via open3d.
3. `_watertight_obj` rebuilds an open mesh with
   [Manifold](https://github.com/hjwdzh/Manifold) (MIT, same author as
   QuadriFlow, which is what its README prescribes). A mesh that is already
   watertight skips this, since the rebuild is an approximation.

QuadriFlow then walks a solver ladder (`-mcf -sharp`, `-sharp`, bare) under one
shared wall-clock budget. Falling back to triangle soup is never one of the
rungs: a quad request that cannot be met is reported as failed, with the solver
output in the message.

## API

All routes require `Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY`, except `/health`.

### `POST /process` → `202`

```bash
curl -X POST https://$SERVICE_URL/process \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
        "mesh": "https://three.ws/avatars/cesium-man.glb",
        "remesh_mode": "quad",
        "target_faces": 20000,
        "texture_size": 1024,
        "output_format": "glb"
      }'
# → { "task_id": "…", "status": "queued", "mode": "quad" }
```

| Field | Required | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `mesh` | yes | n/a | `https://` URL to a GLB / GLTF / OBJ / STL / PLY / FBX (binary, 7.1+) / OFF / DAE (≤ 128 MB) |
| `remesh_mode` | no | `triangle` | `triangle` \| `quad` \| `lowpoly` |
| `operation` | no | `full` | `convert` \| `simplify` \| `repair` \| `full` (triangle mode) |
| `target_faces` | no | `50000` | `1000`–`500000` |
| `texture_size` | no | `1024` | `512` \| `1024` \| `2048` — atlas size for the re-bake |
| `output_format` | no | `glb` | `glb` \| `obj` \| `stl` \| `ply` \| `usdz` \| `3mf` \| `fbx` |

Remote URLs are fetched through the SSRF guard in
[`worker_security.py`](./worker_security.py) — https-only, with private,
loopback, link-local, and cloud-metadata addresses rejected.

A glTF asset that declares `EXT_meshopt_compression` (what `gltfpack` emits, and
what most three.ws avatars ship as) is transcoded to plain glTF by
[`gltf_meshopt.py`](./gltf_meshopt.py) before loading. trimesh has no decoder for
that extension and fails on the compressed asset's fallback buffer, so those
meshes used to fail outright. The `gltfpack` binary is pinned by release tag and
checksum in the [`Dockerfile`](./Dockerfile); set `GLTFPACK_BIN` to run that path
against your own copy locally.

### `GET /tasks/{task_id}`

```json
{
  "task_id": "…",
  "status": "done",
  "result_url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/three-ws-avatar-reconstructions/remesh/….glb",
  "texture_url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/…/remesh/….png",
  "mtl_url": null,
  "face_count": 19842,
  "quad_ratio": 0.94,
  "textured": true,
  "mode": "quad",
  "output_format": "glb",
  "bytes": 1830112,
  "elapsed_ms": 41230
}
```

`status` is `queued` | `running` | `done` | `failed`. On failure the response
carries an `error` and an `error_kind`. `input` means the caller's file was the
problem and `error` says how to fix it (for example `ASCII FBX is not supported:
re-export the model as binary FBX (FBX 7.1 or later) or as GLB`). `internal`
means a service fault: `error` is an opaque `internal error (ref <id>)` and the
full traceback stays in the server log under that id.
`texture_url` / `mtl_url` are populated when a re-bake produces a sidecar PNG or
`.mtl` (e.g. a textured `obj` output).

### `GET /health`

```json
{ "ok": true, "service": "remesh" }
```

Unauthenticated, so Cloud Run's startup probe can reach it.

## Env

| Var | Required | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `API_KEY` | yes | — | Shared bearer secret (Secret Manager: `avatar-reconstruction-key`) |
| `GCS_BUCKET` | yes | — | Output bucket; artifacts land under the `remesh/` prefix (`three-ws-avatar-reconstructions`) |
| `MAX_CONCURRENT` | no | `2` | In-flight jobs |
| `QUADRIFLOW_BIN` | no | `quadriflow` | Path to the QuadriFlow executable. The image builds it and sets this to `/usr/local/bin/quadriflow` |
| `BLENDER_TIMEOUT` | no | `300` | Seconds before a Blender FBX conversion (export, or the FBX input bridge) is killed |
| `MANIFOLD_BIN` | no | `manifold` | Path to the [Manifold](https://github.com/hjwdzh/Manifold) executable (built into the image). Quad mode rebuilds an open mesh watertight with it before QuadriFlow, which requires watertight manifold input |
| `MANIFOLD_RESOLUTION` | no | `50000` | Octree resolution for that rebuild |
| `MANIFOLD_TIMEOUT` | no | `120` | Seconds before the rebuild is abandoned and the raw mesh is used |

## Build and test locally

The image builds from [`Dockerfile`](./Dockerfile) with no arguments or build
args. It compiles QuadriFlow from source and installs the ~1 GB Blender `bpy`
wheel, so a cold build takes several minutes:

```bash
docker build -t remesh workers/remesh
```

[`test_remesh.py`](./test_remesh.py) is the core-path smoke test: the OBJ bridge
to QuadriFlow, repair, QEM decimation, every `operation`, xatlas UV unwrap,
texture bake and seam dilation, every export format, request validation, a real
QuadriFlow quad remesh, a rigged GLB to FBX round trip re-checked with
[`verify_fbx.py`](./verify_fbx.py), FBX *input* through every path (FBX to GLB,
FBX repair to OBJ, FBX behind an extensionless URL, FBX to FBX keeping the rig),
DAE input through pycollada, and the input errors for ASCII and corrupt FBX. The Docker build runs it as a gate, so a
regression fails the image instead of reaching Cloud Run. Run it on its own
against the built image:

```bash
docker run --rm remesh python test_remesh.py
```

Serving the container locally additionally needs credentials that can write
`GCS_BUCKET`: results are uploaded straight to GCS, and `storage.Client()` is
constructed at startup, so a container without application-default credentials
fails its startup probe rather than failing per job.

## How it ships

Built and deployed by **Google Cloud Build** from
[`cloudbuild.yaml`](./cloudbuild.yaml) to **Cloud Run**: service
`remesh-service` in `us-central1` (project `aerial-vehicle-466722-p5`), 8 vCPU /
16 GiB, port 8080, kept warm (`min 1`, `max 3`), 300 s request timeout, always-on
CPU (`--no-cpu-throttling`), run as the `avatar-reconstruction-sa` service
account. `API_KEY` is mounted from the `avatar-reconstruction-key` secret;
`GCS_BUCKET` is set to `three-ws-avatar-reconstructions`.

Always-on CPU is load-bearing rather than a tuning knob. `POST /process` answers
`202` and finishes the job in a background task, so every expensive step runs
outside a request; under Cloud Run's default throttling the container is given
almost no CPU there. On 2026-08-09 a 2000-face lowpoly bake that measures around
160 s under active polling took 51,173 s (14 h) once its caller stopped polling,
and on 2026-08-06 a quad job tripped the 600 s QuadriFlow guard for the same
reason.

Submit the build from the repo root. The config's build step sets
`dir: workers/remesh`, which is resolved against the submitted source, so
submitting this directory instead of `.` fails to find the Dockerfile:

```bash
gcloud builds submit --config workers/remesh/cloudbuild.yaml .
```

This is not a GitHub Actions job — three.ws has no Actions; all CI/CD runs on
Cloud Build. See [`docs/ops/gcp-model-workers.md`](../../docs/ops/gcp-model-workers.md)
for how the model/post-gen workers are operated and
[`docs/ops/gcp-production.md`](../../docs/ops/gcp-production.md) for the platform
production runbook.

## How three.ws calls it

The platform never talks to this service directly from the browser. The GCP
provider (`api/_providers/gcp.js`, `remesh` mode) reads its URL from
**`GCP_REMESH_URL`** and the shared key from **`GCP_RECONSTRUCTION_KEY`**, maps
the tool request onto `POST /process` (`resultKey: result_url`), and polls
`GET /tasks/:id` until `done`, surfacing `face_count`, `quad_ratio`, and
`textured` back to the caller. It backs the free `/api/forge-remesh` tool and the
paid `POST /api/x402/pipeline-remesh` stage (`api/x402/pipeline-remesh.js`); a
lane missing either env var drops out cleanly and is reported
`configured: false`.
