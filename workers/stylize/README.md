# Stylize worker

One-click **geometric stylization filters** for 3D meshes. Takes any input mesh
and rebuilds it as a stylized variant using pure geometry processing —
`trimesh` + `numpy` + `scipy` + `open3d`, **no model inference and no GPU**.
That makes it fast and cheap on CPU, and it never depends on a model lane being
warm.

It backs the forge pipeline's post-generation stylize tool: exposed to the web
at [`/api/forge-stylize`](../../api/forge-stylize.js) and to agents over MCP as
`stylize_model`. It is not a primary text/image→3D generation lane — it
transforms a mesh you already have.

## Filters

The catalog is the single source of truth (`STYLE_CATALOG` in
[`main.py`](main.py)); `GET /styles` serves it verbatim so the UI gallery and
the density knob stay in lockstep. Each filter has one density knob with a
default and clamped `min`/`max`:

| Key       | Name          | What it does | Resolution (`default` / `min`–`max`) |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|--------------------------------------|
| `voxel`   | Voxel         | Voxelize the surface and rebuild it as solid, source-colored cubes (Minecraft-style). | 32 / 8–96 |
| `brick`   | Brick         | Voxel grid plus a cylindrical stud on each column's top block — a buildable toy-brick look. | 24 / 8–64 |
| `voronoi` | Voronoi shell | Decimate to a coarse shell, thicken its edges into an open strut-and-node lattice (3D-print ready). | 48 / 12–120 |
| `lowpoly` | Low-poly      | Quadric-decimate, then unweld every face for hard flat shading — the classic faceted game-asset look. | 40 / 8–120 |

Source color/material is preserved where the style allows: each output element
is tinted by sampling the nearest source-face color (vertex colors, texture via
`to_color`, or a material base color), falling back to a tasteful cool-neutral
default when the mesh carries no color of its own. (That fallback is gated on
trimesh's `visual.defined`, because trimesh otherwise hands back a stock flat
gray for an uncolored mesh, which reads as a real color and is not one.) A mesh
with no size at all is refused rather than stylized into invisible geometry.
Hard safety caps (`MAX_VOXELS = 60_000`,
`MAX_LATTICE_EDGES = 6_000`, `MAX_MESH_BYTES = 128 MiB`) mean a hostile or huge
input can never exhaust memory — resolution backs off automatically.

Input formats: `.glb`, `.gltf`, `.obj`, `.stl`, `.ply`, `.off`, `.dae` (DAE
through `pycollada`, which `trimesh[easy]` installs). Output formats: `glb`
(default), `obj`, `stl`, `ply`.

**FBX is not accepted.** trimesh has no FBX reader and this image carries no
converter, so an FBX is refused up front instead of failing inside the parser:

- an `.fbx` mesh URL is a `422` whose message names the formats above;
- an FBX behind an extensionless or signed URL is caught by its bytes (the
  binary `Kaydara FBX Binary` magic or an ASCII `; FBX` header) and the task
  fails with `error_kind: "input"` and that same caller-facing message, not an
  opaque `internal error (ref …)`;
- `/api/forge-stylize` answers `400 unsupported_mesh_format` and the
  `stylize_model` MCP tool returns an error before any job is queued.

To restyle an FBX, convert it to GLB first with the remesh worker
(`operation: "convert"`, `output_format: "glb"`, via `/api/forge-remesh` or the
`remesh_model` MCP tool), which reads binary FBX through headless Blender, then
stylize the GLB it returns.

A glTF asset that declares `EXT_meshopt_compression` (what `gltfpack` emits, and
what most three.ws avatars ship as) is transcoded to plain glTF by
[`gltf_meshopt.py`](gltf_meshopt.py) before loading: trimesh has no decoder for
that extension and fails on the compressed asset's fallback buffer, so every
filter used to fail on those meshes. The
[`gltfpack`](https://github.com/zeux/meshoptimizer) binary behind it is pinned by
release tag and checksum in the [`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile); point `GLTFPACK_BIN`
at your own copy to run that path locally.

## HTTP contract

Bearer-authenticated on `/process` and `/tasks/:id`; `/styles` and `/health`
are public. A missing, malformed, or wrong `Authorization: Bearer <key>` header
is a `401`. Jobs are async: `POST /process` returns immediately with a
`task_id`, then you poll `GET /tasks/:id`.

### `POST /process` → `202`

```json
{
  "mesh": "https://…/model.glb",
  "style": "voxel",
  "resolution": 32,
  "output_format": "glb"
}
```

`mesh` is required and must be a public https URL (the worker's
`worker_security.fetch_remote_bytes` rejects private/loopback/metadata hosts —
SSRF defense; `/api/forge-stylize` also pre-validates it). `style` defaults to
`voxel`, `resolution` is clamped to the style's bounds (a missing/`null` value
uses the default), `output_format` defaults to `glb`. An `.fbx` `mesh` is a
`422` that names the supported input formats.

Response:

```json
{ "task_id": "…uuid…", "status": "queued", "style": "voxel", "resolution": 32 }
```

### `GET /tasks/:id` → `200`

```json
{
  "task_id": "…uuid…",
  "status": "done",
  "result_url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/three-ws-avatar-reconstructions/stylize/<id>.glb",
  "face_count": 14400,
  "style": "voxel",
  "resolution": 32,
  "output_format": "glb",
  "bytes": 512340,
  "elapsed_ms": 1830
}
```

`status` is `queued` → `running` → `done` | `failed`. On failure the body
carries an `error` and an `error_kind`: `input` means the caller's file was the
problem and `error` says how to fix it (an FBX, for example); `internal` means a
service fault and `error` is an opaque `internal error (ref <id>)` that matches
the full traceback in the service log. Unknown ids return `404`. The finished mesh is
uploaded to the `GCS_BUCKET` under `stylize/<task_id>.<format>` and served from
its public GCS URL; that upload retries transient transport failures, so a TLS
blip no longer discards work the worker already did.

Task records are instance-local and bounded: the most recent
`MAX_TRACKED_TASKS = 500` are kept, oldest finished ones evicted first, and a
queued or running job is never evicted. Poll promptly and keep the `result_url`,
which is durable; the record behind it is not (a restart clears it either way,
and `api/_providers/gcp.js` already maps that `404` to a terminal
`gcp_task_missing`).

### `GET /styles` → `200`

The filter catalog (key, name, description, resolution bounds) — drives the UI
gallery. Public, no auth.

### `GET /health` → `200`

```json
{ "ok": true, "service": "stylize", "styles": ["voxel", "brick", "voronoi", "lowpoly"] }
```

### OIN routes (only with `OIN_ENABLED=true`)

The same filters are also offered over the Open Inference Protocol
([`specs/OPEN_INFERENCE_PROTOCOL.md`](../../specs/OPEN_INFERENCE_PROTOCOL.md)),
so an outside node operator can run this worker and return signed receipts:
`GET /.well-known/oin` (signed advertisement of the `mesh.stylize` capability),
`POST /oin/jobs`, `GET /oin/jobs/:id`. The job envelope carries the mesh URL as
`input.data` and the style as `input.model`, with `params.resolution` and
`params.output_format` as the knobs; the response commits to the artifact's
`sha256` and byte length, signed with `OIN_SIGNING_KEY`. Jobs use the same
bearer secret as `/process`. With the flag unset none of these routes exist.

## Environment

| Var | Required | Default | Meaning |
|-----|----------|---------|---------|
| `API_KEY` | yes | — | Bearer secret for `/process` + `/tasks`. In production it is the shared model-worker key (Secret Manager `avatar-reconstruction-key`, mounted by `cloudbuild.yaml`). |
| `GCS_BUCKET` | yes | — | Output bucket for stylized meshes (prod: `three-ws-avatar-reconstructions`). |
| `MAX_CONCURRENT` | no | `2` | In-process semaphore bounding concurrent jobs. |
| `GLTFPACK_BIN` | no | `gltfpack` | Path to the meshopt decoder. The image ships it on `PATH`. |
| `OIN_ENABLED` | no | unset | `true` mounts the OIN routes (see below). Anything else leaves the worker byte-for-byte its pre-OIN self. |
| `OIN_SIGNING_KEY` | with OIN | (none) | base64 Ed25519 seed. With `OIN_ENABLED=true` and no key the worker refuses to boot, so a node can never advertise a key it cannot sign with. |
| `OIN_NODE_ID` | no | `three-ws-stylize` | Node identity in the advertisement. |
| `OIN_RESULT_DIR` | no | unset | Write OIN artifacts to this directory instead of GCS. Set it and the worker skips the GCS client entirely, so a local run needs no cloud credentials. |
| `OIN_RESULT_BASE_URL` | with `OIN_RESULT_DIR` | (none) | Public base URL the directory is served from; the signed `output.url` is built from it. |

## How it ships

Deployed as the Cloud Run service **`stylize-service`** in **`us-central1`**
(live base URL `https://stylize-service-lp642k3kpa-uc.a.run.app`), built by Cloud
Build from [`cloudbuild.yaml`](cloudbuild.yaml) (CPU-only: `--cpu=8
--memory=16Gi`, `--min-instances=1 --max-instances=3`, 300 s timeout,
`--no-cpu-throttling`, run SA `avatar-reconstruction-sa`, build SA
`three-ws-build@` as every build in this project must pin). It is kept warm
rather than scaled to zero: a job itself finishes in under ten seconds, so a cold
start on top of it would be the dominant stall in an interactive edit. CPU
throttling stays off because the work happens in a background task after the
`202`, where a throttled container would crawl while still holding one of the
two concurrency slots.

Submit from the **repo root** and pass `SHORT_SHA` explicitly, since the config
tags images with it and `gcloud builds submit` does not populate it:

```bash
gcloud builds submit --config workers/stylize/cloudbuild.yaml \
  --region us-central1 --project aerial-vehicle-466722-p5 \
  --substitutions=SHORT_SHA=manual$(date +%s) .
```

The build runs [`test_stylize.py`](test_stylize.py) as a gate, so a regression in
any filter stops the image instead of reaching a user mid-edit.

three.ws reaches it through [`api/_providers/gcp.js`](../../api/_providers/gcp.js)
(`stylize` mode) when **`GCP_STYLIZE_URL`** points at the service URL and the
shared **`GCP_RECONSTRUCTION_KEY`** is set. If either is missing the lane drops
out of routing and `/api/forge-stylize` returns `503 unconfigured` — nothing is
faked. See [`docs/ops/gcp-model-workers.md`](../../docs/ops/gcp-model-workers.md)
for the model-worker fleet, its shared bearer secret, and routing.

> Ops context: three.ws's own front end and API run on Cloud Run service
> `three-ws-api` (also `us-central1`); the model workers like this one are
> separate Cloud Run services built by Cloud Build. There are no GitHub Actions
> — builds and deploys run through Cloud Build. See
> [`docs/ops/gcp-production.md`](../../docs/ops/gcp-production.md).

### Run locally

```bash
cd workers/stylize
pip install -r requirements.txt
API_KEY=dev-secret GCS_BUCKET=your-dev-bucket \
  uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
```

(Uploads need Application Default Credentials with write access to
`GCS_BUCKET`.) The container image installs the GL, OpenMP and BLAS system libs
open3d and trimesh need for headless mesh IO, plus the pinned `gltfpack` binary
for meshopt input. It ships no assimp: nothing in the worker loads it.

To run it as a self-hosted OIN node with no cloud account at all, keep results
on disk and skip GCS entirely:

```bash
API_KEY=dev-secret GCS_BUCKET=unused \
OIN_ENABLED=true OIN_SIGNING_KEY="$(python3 -c 'import base64,os;print(base64.b64encode(os.urandom(32)).decode())')" \
OIN_RESULT_DIR=/tmp/oin-artifacts OIN_RESULT_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080/artifacts \
  uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
```

## Tests

```bash
python3 workers/stylize/test_stylize.py
```

[`test_stylize.py`](test_stylize.py) covers the core path with no GCS, no
network, and no server: the catalog and its resolution bounds, request
validation, scene loading, color preservation and the untextured fallback, all
four filters (geometry, tint, and the shape property each one promises), the
zero-extent refusal, the `MAX_VOXELS` / `MAX_LATTICE_EDGES` backoff, an export
round-trip in every output format, the SSRF gate, the `401` contract, the upload
retry policy, the meshopt decode, the OIN protocol primitives, and the OIN job
executor end to end against a real result sink. It needs `trimesh`, `numpy`,
`scipy`, `pillow`, `fastapi` (its `TestClient`, so `httpx` too), `pydantic`, and
`google-cloud-storage`. Two dependencies are optional locally and present in the
image, so the Docker build gate is what exercises their paths: `open3d`
(`_decimate` falls back to trimesh without it) and `gltfpack` (without it the
suite pins the readable failure instead of round-tripping a compressed asset).

## Usage example

Stylize a GLB into voxels, then poll for the result:

```bash
BASE="https://stylize-service-XXXXXXXX-uc.a.run.app"   # or http://localhost:8080
KEY="$GCP_RECONSTRUCTION_KEY"

# 1. submit
TASK=$(curl -s -X POST "$BASE/process" \
  -H "authorization: Bearer $KEY" \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"mesh":"https://storage.googleapis.com/three-ws-avatar-reconstructions/example.glb","style":"voxel","resolution":32,"output_format":"glb"}' \
  | python3 -c 'import sys,json;print(json.load(sys.stdin)["task_id"])')

# 2. poll until done
curl -s "$BASE/tasks/$TASK" -H "authorization: Bearer $KEY"
```

Or, through the platform (no worker URL/secret needed by the caller):

```bash
curl -s -X POST https://three.ws/api/forge-stylize \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"mesh_url":"https://…/model.glb","style":"lowpoly","resolution":40}'
# → 202 { "job_id", "status":"queued", "style", "resolution", "output_format" }
# poll: GET https://three.ws/api/forge-stylize?job=<job_id>
```
