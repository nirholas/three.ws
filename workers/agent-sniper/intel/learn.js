// Coin Intelligence - the learning loop.
//
// Watching is only half of "learns from watching". Here we:
//   1. labelOutcomes()  - revisit observed coins after the fact and record what
//      actually happened (graduated / pumped / flat / rugged) as ground truth.
//   2. trainWeights()   - correlate each launch-time signal with good outcomes
//      and persist per-signal weights the scorer reads. The dataset grows, the
//      weights sharpen, the sniper's judgment improves. No black box: weights
//      are plain correlations anyone can inspect.
//
// Run both from a cron (see api/cron or the worker loop). Pure-math helpers are
// exported for testing.

// The v2 coin route. pump.fun retired `/coins/:mint` on this host around

// every Oracle refit retrained on the same rows. `/coins-v2/:mint` carries every
// field this module reads (complete, pump_swap_pool, usd_market_cap, market_cap,
