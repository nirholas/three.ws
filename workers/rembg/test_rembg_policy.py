"""Unit tests for the pure request policy (rembg_policy.py): model-name
resolution, caller-error typing, task retention. Stdlib only, no ONNX weights,
no GCS, no FastAPI. Runs locally and as a Docker build gate:

    python3 workers/rembg/test_rembg_policy.py

These pin the rules the service is easy to break silently: an alias that stops
resolving turns every "rmbg2" request into a different model, and a retention
bug either leaks the task map forever (the service runs with min-instances=1,
so an instance lives for weeks) or evicts a job someone is still polling.
