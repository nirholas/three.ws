// The second lock on /api/cron/*, applied at the edge before the handler runs.
//
// Cron auth is a per-file inline call to requireCron (api/_lib/cron-auth.js),
// which is correct and fail-closed today: tests/api/cron-auth-sweep.test.js
// invokes every handler in that directory unauthenticated on every run and
// requires a closed status from each. But it is a convention, not a
// mechanism. The server's filesystem phase routes every api/cron/*.js file
// by existing, so ONE future handler that forgets the line is directly
// internet-invokable, and money-moving sweeps live in that directory
// (custody attestation, buybacks, treasury top-ups, wallet intents). This
// layer makes that single omission survivable: the request never reaches
// the handler at all.
//
// Two credentials are accepted, and both stay accepted permanently. This is
// defense in depth, not a migration with a cutover:
//
//   1. CRON_SECRET, exactly as the handlers validate it. The verdict comes from
//      isCronAuthorized() rather than a second comparison written here, so the
//      edge and the handler can never disagree about what a valid secret is.
//   2. A Google-signed OIDC identity token from the Cloud Scheduler service
//      account, which is what `gcloud scheduler jobs update http
//      --oidc-service-account-email` attaches. Unlike a bearer secret this one
//      cannot be replayed off a leaked env dump: it is short-lived, signed by
//      Google, and bound to one audience.
//
// Both halves of the OIDC identity are required, and the email half is the
// load-bearing one: ANY Google service account can mint an ID token for an
// arbitrary audience, so an audience match alone authenticates nobody. The
// token must carry a verified email in CRON_OIDC_SERVICE_ACCOUNT *and* an
// audience in CRON_OIDC_AUDIENCE. With either var unset the OIDC path is off
// and only the secret is accepted.
//
// What this layer must never do is invent a new fail-open. The one case where
// it stands aside is "no credential is configured at all" (no CRON_SECRET, no
// OIDC pair), which is a developer's machine: there the request falls through
// to the handler, whose requireCron answers the single canonical 503
// not_configured. Production, which has CRON_SECRET set, is closed here.
