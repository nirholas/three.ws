# NVIDIA Inception: social copy

Paste-ready posts for the announcement that never went out. Membership was
accepted July 2026 and [announcement-coverage.md](../../docs/announcement-coverage.md)
shows the `/nvidia` surface with an empty "announced on X" column, while `/openai`
has a real post behind it. This file closes that gap.

Strategy, priorities, and every other NVIDIA surface:
[docs/nvidia-visibility-map.md](../../docs/nvidia-visibility-map.md).

**Posting is owner-gated.** Everything here is drafted and ready; none of it has
been posted.

**Asset gate, updated 2026-09-14:** NVIDIA says the current kit is available at
`Inception portal > Benefits > Co-Branded Marketing Assets`. Download and reconcile that
package with the checked-in badge before using any post below. The copy is ready; official
asset and guideline verification is the remaining gate.

## The rules these posts follow

Read before editing anything below. Getting these wrong on a post that tags
NVIDIA is worse than not posting.

1. **"NVIDIA Inception member." Never "NVIDIA partner."** Inception is a startup
   program. No "backed by NVIDIA", no "partnered with NVIDIA", no implied
   investment or endorsement. This is the same rule the site footer badge and
   [docs/partners.md](../../docs/partners.md) already enforce.
2. **Tag by topic, not by reach.** `@NVIDIAAIDev` for digital humans and
   developer work, NVIDIA for Startups on LinkedIn for the membership itself.
   Blasting `@NVIDIA` on a developer story gets ignored. The full topic-to-account
   table is in the visibility map.
3. **`#NVIDIAInception` on every post.** It is the tag NVIDIA's social team
   monitors, and it is how a member post becomes a resharable one.
4. **Use the official badge.** [public/marks/nvidia-inception-badge.svg](../../public/marks/nvidia-inception-badge.svg),
   unmodified. Do not recolor, crop, or place it on a busy background.
5. **No coin.** These posts are about GPUs and digital humans. The token has no
   place in a thread aimed at NVIDIA's developer audience.
6. **Every number must be current.** The GPU fleet count changes. Recount with the
   command in the visibility map before posting anything that quotes it.

## One post, if you post only one

X, `@trythreews`, with the badge image attached.

generation finishing.

## X thread (the version that earns replies)

Post 1 is the post above. Then:

**2/**

> no upload to a server you don't control.

**3/**
> Voice and face are NVIDIA end to end. Riva ASR listens, Nemotron reasons, Magpie

>
> Most Audio2Face work lives in Unreal or Omniverse. This is in a tab:

**4/**

## LinkedIn

Tag **NVIDIA for Startups**. Longer form works better here than on X.

## The Audio2Face clip (highest-value standalone post)

This is the most differentiated asset on the platform and it deserves its own post
rather than being buried in a thread.

Capture a 15-second screen recording at `/demos/audio2face`: audio in, face
lip-syncing, browser chrome visible so it is obvious there is no game engine.

## Telegram, holders channel

Shorter, no hashtags, no tagging.

## After posting

1. Fill in the `/nvidia` row in [announcement-coverage.md](../../docs/announcement-coverage.md)
   with the post URL and date, the way the `/openai` row is filled in.
2. Add the post URL as `source_url` on the `2026-07-18-nvidia-inception-public`
   event in [data/timeline.json](../../data/timeline.json), which is currently
   `null`.
3. While you are in that file: `2026-07-18-jensen-huang` records an interaction
   from NVIDIA's CEO and also has a `null` source. If that link can be recovered
   from account history, it is the most valuable citation this company owns.
   Archive it to `web.archive.org` once found.
