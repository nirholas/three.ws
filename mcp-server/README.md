> MCP tools from [three.ws](https://three.ws), **five need no payment, wallet, or API key to start**: `forge_free` (text prompt → 3D GLB on the free NVIDIA NIM / Microsoft TRELLIS lane), `vanity_premium` (browse the pre-ground premium vanity inventory), and the crypto-news trio (`crypto_news`, `crypto_news_digest`, and `crypto_news_archive`, archive search is free up to a daily quota, then $0.001 USDC per search via x402). The rest are paid: text/image→3D mesh generation, 3D avatars, one-call text→rigged-avatar generation, GLB auto-rigging, conversational model refinement, material restyling, pose seeds, pump.fun snapshots, ERC-8004 agent reputation, ENS/SNS resolution, agent-to-agent delegation and end-to-end agent hiring, token sentiment, AgenC coordination reads, aixbt market intel, and a Solana vanity grinder. Paid calls are settled in USDC via the [x402](https://x402.org) payment protocol on Solana mainnet (`exact` scheme). No subscription, no API key, pay per call, and failed calls never bill the caller.

---

## Quickstart (30 seconds)

### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add 3d-agent -- npx -y @three-ws/mcp-server
```

To also receive payments (server operators), pass the payout address as env: `claude mcp add 3d-agent -e MCP_SVM_PAYMENT_ADDRESS=YourSolanaWallet -- npx -y @three-ws/mcp-server`.

### Claude Desktop

Paste this into your **Claude Desktop** config (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` on macOS, `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` on Windows):

```json
{
	"mcpServers": {
		"3d-agent": {
			"command": "npx",
			"args": ["-y", "@three-ws/mcp-server"],
			"env": {
				"MCP_SVM_PAYMENT_ADDRESS": "YourSolanaWallet"
			}
		}
	}
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop. All tools appear immediately — no install step required.

## Tools

All <!-- mcp-count:three-ws-mcp-server.tools -->25<!-- /mcp-count --> tools are listed below. Most quote a fixed USDC price and settle `exact` on Solana mainnet (prices below come straight from each tool's source); **`forge_free`, `vanity_premium`, `crypto_news`, and `crypto_news_digest` are free**, no payment, no wallet, no API key, and `crypto_news_archive` search is free up to a daily quota (stats/trending always free). Every tool also declares MCP tool annotations (`readOnlyHint`, `destructiveHint`, `idempotentHint`, `openWorldHint`) so clients can scope confirmation prompts correctly, none of these tools are destructive.

### 3D generation

| Tool             | Price  | What it returns                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ---------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `forge_free`     | **Free** | Textured 3D GLB from a **text prompt — at zero cost**. Drives the three.ws `/api/forge` pipeline on the free NVIDIA NIM (Microsoft TRELLIS) text→3D lane — the same engine the [`/forge`](https://three.ws/forge) web page uses for prompt drafts. No x402 payment, no wallet, no API key. Pick tier `draft` (fast, default), `standard`, or `high` — all free. Returns the durable `glbUrl`, a three.ws viewer `preview` link, the `tier`, and the `backend` that actually ran. Text-only; for image/multi-view input or the Granite-directed chain use `mesh_forge`. Feed the `glbUrl` to `rig_mesh` to animate it. |
| `mesh_forge`     | $0.25  | Textured 3D GLB from a **text prompt or a reference image**. Text mode runs a chain of specialist models — an IBM Granite "prompt director" rewrites the prompt into an optimized single-subject 3D spec, FLUX renders a reference image, and Microsoft TRELLIS / Tencent Hunyuan3D reconstruct the mesh. Image mode (`image_url`) reconstructs directly. Returns the durable `glbUrl`, a three.ws viewer `preview`, the `directedPrompt`, and timing. |
| `rig_mesh`       | $0.20  | Auto-rig a static GLB into an animation-ready model: humanoid skeleton + per-vertex skin weights via Make-It-Animatable. Takes a `glb_url` (e.g. `mesh_forge`'s output), returns the `riggedGlbUrl` and a three.ws pose-studio link.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `forge_avatar`   | $0.45  | **Text/image → rigged, animation-ready avatar in ONE call.** Chains the whole pipeline: Granite prompt director → FLUX + TRELLIS/Hunyuan3D reconstruction → Make-It-Animatable rigging, so the result loads straight into the pose studio and plays the canonical idle/walk library. Takes a `prompt`, a single `image_url`, or 1-4 `image_urls` (front/back/left/right) for higher-fidelity multi-view. A humanoid gate rejects a clearly non-humanoid subject **without charge** (use `mesh_forge` / `forge_free` for those, or set `allow_non_humanoid`). Returns the rigged GLB, the intermediate mesh, a pose-studio link, the directed prompt, and per-stage timing. |
| `text_to_avatar` | $0.15  | Textured 3D GLB avatar from a text prompt or reference image URLs, driving Replicate (Hunyuan-3D 3.1 by default). Returns the GLB URL, model version, prediction id, and timing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `refine_model`   | $0.25  | Iterate on a model by describing a change in plain language ("make it metallic", "bigger helmet"). Re-generates a **new** version anchored to the previous one (the prior prompt is folded with your change; an optional reference image anchors it as image→3D): real generation, never a fake diff. Each refinement appends to an immutable parent→child version lineage, so you can branch from an earlier version (`parent_index`) or revert. Pass `parent_lineage` to extend a thread. Returns the new GLB, a viewer link, the composed prompt, the lineage, and the active version index. |
| `restyle_material` | $0.05 | Re-skin an existing GLB **without regenerating its mesh** (geometry and UVs preserved exactly). Two modes: `instruction` ("make it chrome", "cyberpunk neon") for an AI-proposed PBR material, or `preset` (+ `seed`/`count`) for N reproducible colorway variants: same preset + seed always yields the same set. Shares `refine_model`'s lineage, so a restyle is just another version; the source GLB is never modified. Returns durable GLB URL(s), the applied PBR factors, and the lineage. |
| `get_pose_seed`  | $0.001 | Deterministic seed + full Euler-rotation pose map (radians) for the three.ws pose-studio mannequin, matched from the in-repo preset library. Includes a `previewUrl` at `https://three.ws/pose?seed=…&preset=…`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

### Solana & markets

| Tool              | Price  | What it returns                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ----------------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pump_snapshot`   | $0.005 | Live token snapshot — USD price (Jupiter), 24h volume + pair (Dexscreener), mint metadata + image (pump.fun frontend-api-v3), and on-chain top-holder distribution (Solana RPC). Adds Helius DAS data when `HELIUS_API_KEY` is set.                                                     |
| `sentiment_pulse` | $0.003 | Sentiment for a Solana token: scores the coin's recent pump.fun callouts (plus optional caller-supplied snippets) with the three.ws deterministic lexicon. Returns overall + per-source breakdown with examples. Pairs with `pump_snapshot`.                                                       |
| `vanity_grinder`  | $0.05  | Solana keypair whose base58 address starts with `prefix` (and optionally ends with `suffix`). Returns the full base58 secret key — treat as a secret. Flat price (override with `MCP_VANITY_PRICE_USD`); a difficulty guard rejects prefixes too long to mine within the iteration cap. |
| `vanity_premium`  | FREE   | Browse the **premium** vanity inventory: long (4-5+ char) brandable Solana addresses ground ahead of time on batch CPU and sold from stock, which the live grinder cannot reach. Read-only and free: returns each address, its rarity tier, a difficulty-scaled price ($1-$50), and a ready-to-pay x402 `buyUrl`. Paying that URL (USDC on Base or Solana) reveals the private key exactly once; the ciphertext is destroyed on delivery. Filter by prefix or tier, sort by rarity/price/newest. Keys are platform-generated: use as a token mint or sweep to self-generated custody, not as a treasury. |
| `aixbt_intel`     | $0.01  | aixbt narrative intelligence feed — recent intel items across crypto with category, description, observation count, official-source flag, and the project/ticker concerned. Optional category/chain filter. Live aixbt REST API.                                                        |
| `aixbt_projects`  | $0.01  | aixbt momentum scan — projects ranked by spiking/climbing/active scores, with ticker, chain, market metrics (price, mcap, 24h volume + change), and recent intel. Filter by names or chain. Live aixbt REST API.                                                                        |
| `crypto_news`     | FREE   | Live crypto headlines aggregated natively by three.ws from 197 publisher RSS/Atom feeds in 17 languages. Filter by category, source, or language, or full-text search. Each article carries the publisher link, publish time, detected tickers, and lexicon sentiment. No payment, no key.       |
| `crypto_news_digest` | FREE | The last 1–72h of coverage clustered into distinct narratives — title, plain-language summary, bullish/bearish stance, tickers, coverage count, and every real article behind each story. Names its engine honestly (`llm` semantic grouping or `heuristic` Jaccard clustering). No payment, no key. |
| `crypto_news_archive` | FREE tier | Search 660,000+ archived articles back to September 2017 (refreshed hourly) by keyword, ticker, source, date range, sentiment, or language — with market context at publication where captured. `mode: stats` and `mode: trending` for corpus statistics and most-covered tickers (always free, no key). Search has a free daily quota (60/day per IP), then $0.001 USDC per search via x402 on the HTTP API; an exhausted quota returns a `payment_required` envelope with the price and networks. |

### Agents & identity

| Tool                    | Price   | What it returns                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ----------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `agent_reputation`      | $0.01   | ERC-8004 reputation: `getReputation`, `getTotalStake`, and the latest `ReputationSubmitted` / `ReputationStaked` events from the canonical ReputationRegistry on the requested chain (default Base). Resolves `agentId` from a wallet address automatically. |
| `agent_delegate_action` | $0.01   | Send a message to a three.ws-registered agent and receive its response (it uses its configured Claude model + system prompt). Agents opted out of MCP delegation are refused. For agent-to-agent collaboration and tool composition.                         |
| `agent_hire_discover`   | $0.01   | **Step one of the commerce loop.** Shortlist three.ws agents to hire for a task, ranked by task fit + live ERC-8004 on-chain reputation + real engagement. Each candidate carries its reputation evidence, capability/task-match score, and the exact USDC price `agent_hire` will settle. Optionally gate by a minimum reputation. |
| `agent_hire`            | $0.05   | **Step two.** Hire an agent end to end: quote the price up front, settle real USDC via x402, run the remote agent, and return its result **plus** a provenance receipt (agent, reputation, amount paid, on-chain settlement reference, latency) rendered as an inline MCP Apps receipt card. Enforces hard spend caps (per-call `MCP_AGENT_HIRE_MAX_PER_CALL_USD`, per-session `..._PER_SESSION_USD`), a `confirm` threshold, and an optional reputation floor: a blocked or failed hire never charges the caller. Needs `MCP_AGENT_TALK_TOKEN`. |
| `ens_sns_resolve`       | $0.0005 | Resolve a human-readable name across **ENS** (`.eth` → Ethereum address via ethers) and **SNS** (`.sol` → Solana owner wallet via Bonfida, plus the wallet's other owned `.sol` domains). Suffix-less names are tried against both.                          |
| `agenc_list_tasks`      | $0.001  | List every public AgenC task created by a Solana wallet — task PDA, state, reward, deadline, worker counts, reward mint. AgenC (agenc.tech, Tetsuo Corp) is a Solana task-coordination protocol. `cluster` defaults to mainnet.                              |
| `agenc_get_task`        | $0.001  | On-chain state + lifecycle timeline of a single AgenC task. Pass `taskPda` or `{creator, taskId}` (hex or any UTF-8 label). Returns state, reward, deadline, worker counts, lifecycle events, reward mint.                                                   |
| `agenc_get_agent`       | $0.001  | An AgenC agent's on-chain registration. Pass `agentPda` or `agentId` (hex or UTF-8 label). Returns authority wallet, capability bitmask, endpoint URL, status, reputation, stake, and active task count.                                                     |

## Installation

The server runs locally on your machine and speaks stdio JSON-RPC — your MCP client spawns it automatically via the `npx` command above. You do not need to `npm install` globally.

If you prefer a global install:

```bash
npm install -g @three-ws/mcp-server
```

Then replace `"command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "@three-ws/mcp-server"]` with `"command": "3d-agent-mcp"` in your config.

---

## Environment variables

### Payout (set this to receive payments yourself)

| Var                       | Description                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `MCP_SVM_PAYMENT_ADDRESS` | Solana USDC payout address (base58) where tools receive payment. Falls back to `X402_PAY_TO_SOLANA` / `X402_PAY_TO`. **If unset, the server still boots and routes paid-call USDC to the three.ws platform payout** — set this to a 32–44 char base58 wallet to collect payments yourself. A configured-but-malformed address fails fast. |

### Optional

| Var                             | Default                               | Description                                                                                                        |

| `SOLANA_RPC_URLS`               | built-in public set                   | **Failover** — comma-separated Solana RPCs tried in order; first healthy one answers                               |
| `MCP_EVM_RPC_<chainId>`         | built-in public set                   | **Failover** — comma-separated EVM RPCs for that chain (`agent_reputation`, ENS uses chain 1)                      |
| `X402_FACILITATOR_URL_SOLANA`   | `https://facilitator.payai.network`   | Primary PayAI Solana facilitator that verifies + settles payments                                                  |
| `X402_FACILITATOR_URLS_SOLANA`  | unset                                 | **Failover** — comma-separated facilitators; earlier entries take precedence at init, a later one covers an outage |
| `X402_FACILITATOR_TOKEN_SOLANA` | unset                                 | Bearer token for the Solana facilitator, if required                                                               |
| `X402_FEE_PAYER_SOLANA`         | three.ws default                      | Fee payer for the settlement transaction                                                                           |
| `MCP_VANITY_PRICE_USD`          | `$0.05`                               | Flat price for `vanity_grinder`                                                                                    |

### `text_to_avatar` (Replicate)

The `text_to_avatar` tool drives Replicate. If the two vars below are unset it returns a `not_configured` error instead of generating — every other tool works without them.

| Var                            | Default                | Description                                                              |

| `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN`          | unset (**required**)   | Replicate API token used to submit the prediction                       |
| `REPLICATE_TEXT_TO_AVATAR_MODEL` | unset (**required**) | Pinned commercial-OK image/text-to-3D version hash (e.g. Hunyuan-3D 3.1) |
| `MCP_TEXT_TO_AVATAR_TIMEOUT_MS` / `MCP_TEXT_TO_AVATAR_POLL_MS` | `110000` / `2000` | Prediction poll budget / interval |
| `MCP_TEXT_TO_AVATAR_REHOST`    | `0`                    | Set `1` to rehost the Replicate GLB to three.ws R2 via `MCP_REHOST_ENDPOINT` + `MCP_REHOST_KEY` |

## Programmatic client

Use `@x402/mcp`'s `wrapMCPClientWithPayment` to call these tools from another Node service. The wrapper auto-handles 402 retries:

```js
import { Client } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client/index.js';
import { StdioClientTransport } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client/stdio.js';
import { wrapMCPClientWithPayment } from '@x402/mcp';
import { x402Client } from '@x402/core/client';
import { registerExactSvmScheme } from '@x402/svm/exact/client';
import { Keypair } from '@solana/web3.js';
import bs58 from 'bs58';

const transport = new StdioClientTransport({
	command: 'npx',
	args: ['-y', '@three-ws/mcp-server'],
	env: {
		// Where the server receives USDC. Your client funds payments from the
		// Solana keypair below.
		MCP_SVM_PAYMENT_ADDRESS: process.env.MCP_SVM_PAYMENT_ADDRESS,
	},
});

const mcp = new Client({ name: 'agent', version: '1.0.0' });
await mcp.connect(transport);

// Solana mainnet, `exact` scheme — the only network/scheme these tools accept.
const payer = Keypair.fromSecretKey(bs58.decode(process.env.AGENT_SOLANA_SECRET_KEY));
const x402 = new x402Client();
registerExactSvmScheme(x402, { signer: payer });
const paid = wrapMCPClientWithPayment(mcp, x402, { autoPayment: true });

const result = await paid.callTool('get_pose_seed', { prompt: 'warrior stance' });
// Prefer MCP structured output; fall back to the text mirror for older servers.
console.log(result.structuredContent ?? JSON.parse(result.content[0].text));
```

`forge_free` needs no payer — it never emits a 402 — so you can call it on the **bare** MCP client (the one before `wrapMCPClientWithPayment`):

```js
// Free text → 3D — no wallet, no payment, no API key.
const free = await mcp.callTool('forge_free', { prompt: 'a glossy white robot mascot', tier: 'draft' });
const out = free.structuredContent ?? JSON.parse(free.content[0].text);
console.log(out.glbUrl, out.preview); // durable GLB + in-browser viewer link
```

---

## Cursor

In Cursor's MCP settings (`Cursor > Settings > Features > MCP`):

```json
{
	"mcpServers": {
		"3d-agent": {
			"command": "npx",
			"args": ["-y", "@three-ws/mcp-server"],
			"env": {
				"MCP_SVM_PAYMENT_ADDRESS": "YourSolanaWallet"
			}
		}
	}
}
```

---

## Run from source

From the monorepo root:

```bash
npm install
node mcp-server/src/index.js
```

Inspect tools interactively:

```bash
npm run inspect --prefix mcp-server
```

## Examples

Runnable walkthroughs of the MCP Streamable HTTP lifecycle against the live three.ws server (curl and plain-fetch Node, zero dependencies) live in [`examples/`](./examples).

---

## Payment flow

The server is the x402 **resource server**. On each tool call:

1. Client sends a `tools/call` request (no payment yet).
2. Server returns `PaymentRequired` (v2 MCP transport spec) with the USDC amount and payment address.
3. A payment-aware client (or `wrapMCPClientWithPayment`) signs and submits the on-chain payment.
4. Client retries the `tools/call` with `_meta["x402/payment"]` attached.
5. Server verifies + settles via the configured facilitator, runs the tool, and returns the result with `_meta["x402/payment-response"]`.

Every tool settles in USDC on **Solana mainnet** with the `exact` scheme (`@x402/svm` ships no `upto`/metered scheme). Each tool quotes a fixed price; there is no post-hoc metering.

A successful result carries the tool's JSON in two forms: `content[0].text` (for text-only clients) and `structuredContent` (MCP 2025-06-18 structured output — a ready-to-use object). A tool-level error sets `isError: true`, and the x402 wrapper **cancels rather than settles** the payment, so failed calls do not bill the caller.

---

## Reliability & failover

Every external dependency has a backup path, so a single provider blip doesn't take a tool down — and no call can hang a paid request indefinitely.

- **Every outbound HTTP call** runs through a shared resilient layer (`src/lib/resilient-fetch.js`): a hard per-attempt timeout plus jittered exponential-backoff retries on transient `429`/`5xx`/network errors, honoring `Retry-After`. Retries are restricted to idempotent reads by default — a non-idempotent action like `agent_delegate_action` gets the timeout but is **never** silently replayed.
- **Solana RPC** (`src/lib/solana-rpc.js`) fails over across an ordered endpoint list (`SOLANA_RPC_URLS`, else the primary, else a built-in public set). A throttling or down endpoint rotates to the back and the next one answers.
- **EVM RPC** (`src/lib/evm-rpc.js`) uses an ethers `FallbackProvider` (quorum 1) over multiple endpoints per chain (`MCP_EVM_RPC_<chainId>` or built-in redundancy), each request timeout-bounded.
- **The x402 facilitator** accepts a comma-separated `X402_FACILITATOR_URLS_SOLANA`: earlier entries take precedence at init, and a later facilitator covers the Solana `exact` kind if the primary's `/supported` is unreachable.
- **Data fallback:** `pump_snapshot` cross-fills its USD price from Dexscreener when Jupiter is unavailable, and each upstream fails soft to a `null`/`{ error }` field rather than failing the whole snapshot.

For maximum redundancy, set dedicated endpoints rather than relying on the public defaults:

```bash
SOLANA_RPC_URLS="https://your-primary-rpc,https://your-secondary-rpc"
MCP_EVM_RPC_8453="https://your-base-rpc,https://base-rpc.publicnode.com"
X402_FACILITATOR_URLS_SOLANA="https://facilitator.payai.network,https://your-backup-facilitator"
```

## Requirements

- Node.js **>= 20** (from `engines`).
- A Solana USDC payout address in `MCP_SVM_PAYMENT_ADDRESS` (or `X402_PAY_TO_SOLANA` / `X402_PAY_TO`) to settle paid calls — see [Environment variables](#environment-variables). Tool registration (names/schemas) needs no env; only an actual paid invocation does.
- A payment-aware MCP client (or `@x402/mcp`'s `wrapMCPClientWithPayment`) funding payments from a Solana keypair.
