// Runs the full enlist proof: requests a wallet-bound challenge, signs it
// locally with the soldier's Solana key, and submits the signature so the
// backend can verify it and confirm a live on-chain holding of the faction coin
// (api/clash enlist → enlist-verify). On success it returns a `warPass` — the
// credential rally_faction spends. Idempotent: re-enlisting the same wallet for
// the same faction just mints a fresh, equivalent pass; nothing accumulates and
// no funds move.

		'Enlist the signer\'s wallet as a soldier in a Coin Clash faction and return a war pass. Requires the wallet to hold the faction coin: the tool requests a challenge, signs it with the wallet\'s Solana key (from the `secret` arg, or SOLANA_SECRET_KEY env), and the backend verifies the signature then checks a live on-chain holding. Returns `{ eligible, wallet, faction, amount, usd, warPass, reason, challengeExpiresAt }`. If `eligible` is false the wallet does not currently hold the coin (`reason: "not_a_holder"`) and `warPass` is null, buy/hold the coin and retry. Keep the `warPass`: pass it to rally_faction to spend taps as battle power. No funds move; the pass expires after ~30 minutes. Use this before rally_faction to get a war pass for a coin the wallet already holds; check get_clash_state first to see which factions are fighting.',
