> `@three-ws/pumpfun-skills` is the official client for the three.ws **pump.fun
> skill set**: the same launch/trade/fee plumbing the three.ws agents use,
> exposed as plain functions instead of [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io)
> tools. It wraps pump.fun's agent transaction API
> (`https://fun-block.pump.fun/agents/*`), which builds the unsigned or
> mint-signed Solana transaction for you, and the public coins read API
> (`frontend-api-v3.pump.fun/coins-v2`). Every function is **coin-agnostic**:
> the mint, amounts, and wallet are supplied at call time; nothing is
> hardcoded. You build, you co-sign, you broadcast. It pairs with
> [`@three-ws/agent-payments`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@three-ws/agent-payments)
> for tokenized-agent invoices and the three.ws launch feed.

## Why

Launching and trading on pump.fun by hand means juggling two SDKs
(`@pump-fun/pump-sdk`, `@pump-fun/pump-swap-sdk`), deriving PDAs, detecting
whether a coin is still on the bonding curve or has graduated to an AMM pool,
quoting slippage, and assembling a versioned transaction, all before you ever ask
the user to sign. These skills collapse that into three calls:

- **One call, a ready transaction.** `createCoin({...})` returns a
  base64 transaction with the mint keypair already signed; you only co-sign
  with the wallet and submit.
- **State-aware swaps.** `swap({...})` auto-detects bonding curve vs. graduated
  AMM and builds the correct route, with slippage and optional Jito MEV
  protection.
- **Fees, read and collected.** `coinFees(mint)` resolves the fee destination
  (creator, cashback, or a sharing config), reports vault balances, and
  `collectFees({...})` builds the claim or distribution transaction.
- **Mint supplied at runtime.** Pass any pump.fun mint you control. There is no
  coin list, no allowlist: generic plumbing, your inputs.
- **MPL-404-ready.** Turn a Pump.fun mint into the fungible backing side of a
  Metaplex Hybrid V1 project, without pretending Pump.fun itself creates NFTs.

This is the SDK twin of the `pumpfun_create_coin`, `pumpfun_swap`, and
`pumpfun_collect_fees` MCP/skill tools: same endpoints, plain functions.

## Install

```bash
npm install @three-ws/pumpfun-skills
```

Works in Node 18+ and the browser (uses `fetch`). To sign and broadcast the
transactions these functions return, add `@solana/web3.js`. The fee-reading
calls go through pump.fun's read API; the build calls go through pump.fun's
agent API; no key, no three.ws account required.

## Quick start

Build a launch transaction for a coin, mint keypair already signed:

```js
import { createCoin } from '@three-ws/pumpfun-skills';

const { transaction, mint } = await createCoin({
  user: 'YourWa11et1111111111111111111111111111111111',
  name: '$THREE',
  symbol: 'THREE',
  uri: 'https://ipfs.io/ipfs/Qm…/metadata.json',
  solLamports: '500000000', // 0.5 SOL initial buy, in lamports
});

// `transaction` is base64; co-sign with the wallet and submit. `mint` is the new coin's address.
```

A full launch → swap → fees loop against a runtime mint:

```js
import { createCoin, swap, coinFees, NATIVE_MINT } from '@three-ws/pumpfun-skills';

// 1. Launch
const launch = await createCoin({
  user: wallet.publicKey.toBase58(),
  name: '$THREE',
  symbol: 'THREE',
  uri: metadataUri,
  solLamports: '250000000',
});

// 2. Buy 0.1 SOL of the coin (auto-routes bonding curve vs AMM)
const buy = await swap({
  inputMint: NATIVE_MINT, // So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112
  outputMint: launch.mint,
  amount: '100000000',    // 0.1 SOL in lamports
  user: wallet.publicKey.toBase58(),
  slippagePct: 2,
});

// 3. Read the fee state for that mint
const fees = await coinFees(launch.mint);
console.log(fees.feeDestination);      // 'creator' | 'cashback' | 'sharing_config'
console.log(fees.creatorVaultLamports); // claimable lamports
```

## API

All build functions return a base64 Solana transaction the caller signs and
broadcasts. Amounts are strings in base units (lamports for SOL, token smallest
units for SPL). `NATIVE_MINT` is re-exported as a convenience for SOL.

Also exported: `createPumpfunSkills(options)` builds a configured client (custom
`fetch`, `agentBaseUrl`, `coinsV2Base`, `apiKey`, `headers`) whose methods match
the functions below; plus the `AGENT_API_BASE`, `COINS_V2_BASE`, and
`FEE_DESTINATIONS` constants and the `ThreeWsError` / `PaymentRequiredError`
error classes.

### `createMpl404Plan(input) → Mpl404Plan`

Creates a validated plan for the maintained Metaplex Hybrid program (commonly
called MPL-404/SPL-404). A Pump.fun launch supplies the fungible SPL mint; a
Metaplex **Core** collection supplies the NFT side. The helper never sends a
transaction or holds a secret key. It returns the exact V1 setup parameters for
your wallet-controlled `initEscrowV1`, followed by `captureV1` and `releaseV1`.

```js
import { createMpl404Plan } from '@three-ws/pumpfun-skills';

const plan = createMpl404Plan({
  tokenMint: launch.mint,       // Pump.fun mint
  collection: coreCollection,
  authority: wallet.publicKey.toBase58(),
  name: '$THREE relics',
  uri: 'https://ipfs.io/ipfs/Qm…/hybrid.json',
  amount: '1000000',            // backing token's smallest units per NFT
});
// Use plan.initEscrowV1 with @metaplex-foundation/mpl-hybrid's V1 instruction.
```

Only Core collections are supported by the upstream hybrid program today;
Token Metadata/pNFT and Token-2022-extension assets must be rejected rather
than silently producing an unusable escrow. Protocol fees are governed by the
deployed program, so confirm the current fee in the wallet flow before signing.

### `createCoin(input) → Promise<BuiltTx & { mint: string }>`

Build a new-coin transaction with an optional initial buy. The mint keypair is
already signed; the user wallet co-signs. Wraps `POST /agents/create-coin`.

|---|---|---|
| `user` | `string` | **Required.** Creator wallet public key. |
| `name` | `string` | **Required.** Token name. |
| `symbol` | `string` | **Required.** Token symbol. |

### `swap(input) → Promise<BuiltTx>`

Build a buy or sell. Auto-detects bonding curve vs. graduated AMM and builds the
matching route. For a **buy**, set `inputMint` to `NATIVE_MINT`; for a **sell**,
set `outputMint` to `NATIVE_MINT`. Wraps `POST /agents/swap`.

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `inputMint` | `string` | **Required.** Mint to spend. `NATIVE_MINT` for SOL buys. |
| `outputMint` | `string` | **Required.** Mint to receive. `NATIVE_MINT` for SOL sells. |
| `amount` | `string` | **Required.** Lamports for SOL, or token smallest units (6 decimals). |
| `user` | `string` | **Required.** User wallet public key (signer). |
| `slippagePct` | `number` | Slippage tolerance, percent. Default `2`. |
| `feePayer` | `string` | Fee payer public key. Defaults to `user`. |
| `frontRunningProtection` | `boolean` | Route via Jito (needs `tipAmount`). |
| `tipAmount` | `number` | Jito tip in SOL. |

### `coinFees(mint) → Promise<FeeInfo>`

Read-only. Resolve the fee destination, vault balances, sharing config, and
graduation state for a mint. Reads the public `coins-v2` API, which carries the
bonding-curve, pool, cashback, and sharing-config state. No transaction, no RPC.

**Returns** `FeeInfo`

|---|---|---|
| `mint` | `string` | The coin mint. |
| `bondingCurve` | `string` | Bonding-curve PDA. |
| `pool` | `string \| null` | AMM pool PDA, or `null` if not graduated. |
| `isGraduated` | `boolean` | True once the coin migrated to an AMM pool. |
| `isCashbackCoin` | `boolean` | True if fees route as cashback. |
| `hasSharingConfig` | `boolean` | True if a fee-sharing config is active. |
| `creator` | `string` | Effective creator public key. |
| `creatorVaultLamports` | `string` | Claimable lamports in the creator vault (`'0'` when `coins-v2` carries no balance). |
| `sharingConfig` | `object \| null` | `{ address, admin, adminRevoked, shareholders[] }`. |
| `feeDestination` | `'creator' \| 'cashback' \| 'sharing_config'` | Where fees go. |

### `collectFees(input) → Promise<BuiltTx>`

| `tipAmount` | `number` | Jito tip in SOL. |

### `sharingConfig(input) → Promise<BuiltTx>`

Create or update a fee-sharing config (up to 10 shareholders; `bps` must total
exactly `10000`). Mode is auto-detected if omitted. Wraps
`POST /agents/sharing-config`.

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `mint` | `string` | **Required.** Token mint. |
| `user` | `string` | **Required.** Creator wallet public key. |
| `shareholders` | `{ address: string; bps: number }[]` | **Required.** `bps` sums to `10000`. |
| `mode` | `'create' \| 'update'` | Auto-detected if omitted. |
| `frontRunningProtection` | `boolean` | Route via Jito. |
| `tipAmount` | `number` | Jito tip in SOL. |

## How it works

Two surfaces, one rule (**the function builds, you sign**):

```
createCoin / swap        coinFees                 collectFees / sharingConfig
   │                        │                          │
   ▼                        ▼                          ▼
POST fun-block.pump.fun   read coins-v2 (curve,      POST fun-block.pump.fun
  /agents/create-coin     pool + fee state)            /agents/collect-fees
  /agents/swap            (no transaction)             /agents/sharing-config
   │                        │                          │
   ▼                        ▼                          ▼
base64 transaction        FeeInfo JSON               base64 transaction
(mint pre-signed for                                 │
 create-coin)                                        │
   └──────────────► you co-sign with the wallet ◄────┘
                          │
                          ▼
                  broadcast to Solana
```

- **Build calls** post your inputs (plus `encoding: 'base64'`) to the pump.fun
  agent API and get back a transaction. `create-coin` returns it with the new
  **mint keypair already signed**: you only add the wallet signature. `swap`,
  `collect-fees`, and `sharing-config` return a transaction for the wallet to
  sign outright.
- **Read calls** (`coinFees`) hit `coins-v2`, which carries the bonding-curve,
  pool, cashback, and sharing-config state, and derive the fee destination and
  balances from it. No wallet, no signing, no RPC.
- **State detection is automatic.** `swap` and `collectFees` inspect whether the
  coin is still on the bonding curve or graduated to an AMM pool and build the
  correct route; you never branch on it yourself.

Override the read backend (e.g. for devnet) with the `PUMP_COINS_V2_BASE`
environment variable; the build API base is `https://fun-block.pump.fun/agents`.

## Errors & edge cases

Every function rejects with a typed `ThreeWsError` carrying a `code`, the HTTP
`status`, and the upstream `body`; a 402 surfaces as `PaymentRequiredError`, a
`ThreeWsError` subclass carrying the x402 challenge. Every state is surfaced,
never swallowed:

| Where | Condition | Meaning | Recovery |
|---|---|---|---|
| `createCoin` / `swap` / `collectFees` | non-2xx from `/agents/*` | pump.fun rejected the build (bad mint, insufficient SOL, malformed input). | Inspect `error.status` + `error.body`; fix inputs and retry. |
| `swap` | coin not found | Mint isn't a pump.fun coin. | Verify the mint. |
| `sharingConfig` | `bps` ≠ 10000 | Shareholder splits don't total 100%. | Adjust `bps` to sum to `10000`. |
| `collectFees` | empty vault | `coinFees(mint).creatorVaultLamports === '0'`. | Read first; skip if nothing to claim. |
| `coinFees` | empty `coins-v2` body | Wrong cluster, or coin missing. | Set `PUMP_COINS_V2_BASE` for devnet. |
| any | `frontRunningProtection: true`, no `tipAmount` | Jito route needs a tip. | Pass `tipAmount` (SOL). |

A built transaction is **partially signed at most**: it is never broadcast for
you. Submitting (and paying network fees) is always the caller's step.

## Examples

**Read before you claim**: never build a no-op collection:

```js
import { coinFees, collectFees } from '@three-ws/pumpfun-skills';

const fees = await coinFees('THREEsynthetic1111111111111111111111111111');
if (fees.feeDestination === 'creator' && fees.creatorVaultLamports !== '0') {
  const { transaction } = await collectFees({ mint: fees.mint, user: creator });
  // co-sign + broadcast `transaction`
}
```

**Split creator fees across a team** (50 / 30 / 20):

```js
import { sharingConfig } from '@three-ws/pumpfun-skills';

const { transaction } = await sharingConfig({
  mint: 'THREEsynthetic1111111111111111111111111111',
  user: creator,
  shareholders: [
    { address: dev,    bps: 5000 },
    { address: design, bps: 3000 },
    { address: ops,    bps: 2000 },
  ], // sums to 10000
});
```

**Sell back to SOL with MEV protection:**

```js
import { swap, NATIVE_MINT } from '@three-ws/pumpfun-skills';

const { transaction } = await swap({
  inputMint: 'THREEsynthetic1111111111111111111111111111',
  outputMint: NATIVE_MINT,
  amount: '1000000',          // 1.0 token (6 decimals)
  user: wallet.publicKey.toBase58(),
  slippagePct: 3,
  frontRunningProtection: true,
  tipAmount: 0.0001,          // Jito tip in SOL
});
```
