		'format this Blender can import (.glb, .gltf, .fbx, .obj, .stl, .ply, .dae, .abc, .usd*, .x3d). Counts describe ' +
		'the file AS LOADED, so a GLB reports more vertices than the .blend it came from (glTF splits vertices at UV ' +
		'and normal seams) while the triangle count is identical. Read-only: the file is never modified. Use this ' +
		'before blender_optimize or blender_convert to see what a file contains and what is making it heavy.',
