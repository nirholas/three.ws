		'THE GATE: anything that moves the house toward safety runs immediately and never prompts (lock, ' +
		'close_cover, close_valve, alarm_arm_*). Anything that OPENS the house is refused by this server and ' +
		'cannot be run from here (unlock, open_cover and open_valve on a door, gate or garage, alarm_disarm, ' +
		'and toggle on any of them), because confirming a physical action needs a person and an MCP client has ' +
		'no person in it. A refusal comes back with `refused: true` and tells you where a human confirms; do ' +
		'not retry it and do not look for an argument that overrides it, because there is none. Everything ' +
		'else (lights, climate, switches, fans, media, covers that are not an opening in the building) just ' +
		'runs. Use this for a single device action the household has no scene for; when one of their scenes or ' +
		'scripts covers it, use `run_macro` instead.',
