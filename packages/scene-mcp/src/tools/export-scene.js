// `export_scene`: merge an already-forged diorama into one exportable GLB.
//
// Wraps POST /api/diorama {action:'export'}. Takes a diorama that already has
// forged objects (glbUrl per object, from compose_scene + your own forging,
// or from a world fetched with get_scene) and merges it server-side into ONE
// glTF 2.0 binary: every object as a named node, plus a real ground disc and
// KHR_lights_punctual lighting tuned to the diorama's mood. The result opens
// cleanly in three.ws Scene Studio (or any glTF viewer) with every object
// individually selectable. Partial worlds export fine; unforged/failed
// objects are just skipped and reported back, never a hard failure.
