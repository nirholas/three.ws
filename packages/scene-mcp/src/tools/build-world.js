// `build_world`: one sentence → a fully forged, exported 3D world. No browser.
//
// Wraps POST /api/diorama {action:'build'}. Runs the ENTIRE diorama pipeline
// server-side in one call: compose the plan (free-first LLM chain), forge
// every object on the free text→3D lane, then merge everything into one GLB
// (same composer as export_scene). This is what the three.ws /diorama page
// does progressively in a browser tab, collapsed into a single tool call for
// agents/MCP clients that have no browser to drive that flow.
//
// Real generation work (an LLM completion plus N free-lane 3D forges), so this
// can legitimately take minutes for a full object set, so the tool requests a
// long timeout accordingly. A forge failure on some objects never fails the
// whole call: the returned diorama reflects exactly what forged, and `skipped`
// names the rest, so you always get the best real world the platform could
// build from your sentence.
