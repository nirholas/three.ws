 * There is no rejection handler on that promise. A house whose uplink flaps can

 * command rejects with a `{ type: "result", success: false }` frame, and the

 *
 * The bug is upstream and is reported there (see the package README). Until a

 * resolves the method off the instance at call time, so replacing it here covers
 * the reconnect path as well as the first subscribe.
