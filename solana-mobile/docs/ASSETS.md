# Listing assets

Drop these files into `solana-mobile/publish/media/` (referenced from `config.yaml`). Every asset must be PNG, RGB or RGBA, no transparency on the icon. Use 100% real product UI — Solana dApp Store reviewers reject mocked screenshots.

## Capture instructions

1. Open three.ws on a real Seeker device (or Saga, or Android emulator with frame size 1080 × 1920).
2. Hide the system navigation bar (Settings → Display → Gesture navigation), so screenshots show only the app chrome.
3. Use the device's native screenshot binding (Power + Vol-Down) for every frame. Do not use the desktop Chrome devtools mobile emulator — reviewers can tell.
4. For the Seed Vault sheet, capture during a real SIWS sign-in to `https://three.ws/api/auth/siws/verify`. The sheet must show `three.ws` as the requesting origin and a non-empty `Nonce: …` line.
5. Drop the resulting PNGs into `solana-mobile/publish/media/` with the exact filenames above.

## Brand consistency

- Surface uses three.ws branding only. Vendor names (Avaturn, RPM, Mixamo, OSOM, Fxtec) must not appear in any screenshot or copy.
- Theme color is `#000000`; background is `#080814`. Do not introduce a third surface color.
- The Solana mark may appear on the Seed Vault sheet but not on the three.ws chrome.
