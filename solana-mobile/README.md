# `solana-mobile/` — three.ws on the Seeker dApp Store

This directory contains everything needed to package three.ws as a Solana Mobile (Seeker / Saga) app and publish it to the on-chain dApp Store.

# Plus: .github/workflows/seeker-release.yml at the repo root
```

## Quickstart

```bash
# 0. Wire the MWA wallet into the three.ws bundle (one-time).
#    Add `import './solana-mobile/src/index.js';` to the top of src/app.js.
#    Install MWA deps:
npm install --save \
  @solana-mobile/mobile-wallet-adapter-protocol \
  @solana-mobile/mobile-wallet-adapter-protocol-web3js

# 1. One-time: mint the on-chain Publisher + App NFTs (mainnet, costs ~0.05 SOL).
cd solana-mobile
SOLANA_KEYPAIR=~/.config/solana/publisher.json ./scripts/init-publisher.sh
# Commit the addresses written into publish/config.yaml.

# 2. Build the signed APK (creates the keystore on first run — back it up!).
KEYSTORE_PASSWORD='your-strong-pass' ./scripts/build-apk.sh
# This also writes /public/.well-known/assetlinks.json with the real fingerprint.

# 3. Deploy three.ws so the assetlinks.json is live.
#    (Standard Vercel deploy — assetlinks must be reachable before submission.)
curl -fsSL https://three.ws/.well-known/assetlinks.json | jq .

# 4. Submit the release.
SOLANA_KEYPAIR=~/.config/solana/publisher.json \
DAPP_STORE_API_KEY='your-api-key' \
./scripts/publish.sh
```

For subsequent releases, only steps 2 and 4 are needed. CI handles both — push a tag matching `seeker-v*` to trigger `.github/workflows/seeker-release.yml`.

## What was NOT added to the bundle (intentional)

- **Promo video** — optional for v1, can be added later via `publish/media/video.mp4`.
- **Screenshots** — must be captured on a real Seeker device (see `docs/ASSETS.md`); no placeholders are checked in because reviewers reject them.
- **Privacy policy + EULA pages** — these are content for the main three.ws site, not this bundle. They must be live at `/legal/privacy` and `/legal/eula` before submission.
