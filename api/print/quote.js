// POST /api/print/quote: printability and price for a real print, in one call.
//
// The /materialize page asks this endpoint every time the buyer changes a
// material, a size or a quantity, so it does two things at once:
//
//   1. Analyzes the mesh (api/_lib/print/analyze.js) and returns the printability
//      report: manifold, shells, open edges, the thinnest wall, the volume money
//      hangs off, and a score with named deductions.
//   2. Prices it (api/_lib/print/quote.js) and returns the itemization plus an
//      HMAC-signed quote token that checkout later charges against.
//
// Omit `materialId` and it is a pure analyze call: free, keyless, no price. That
// is the shape an agent uses to decide whether a mesh is worth printing at all.
//
// Why the server analyzes rather than accepting a client-supplied report: the
// volume in that report IS the price. A report that arrived in the request body
// would let a caller quote a 200 cm3 figure at 2 cm3. The analysis is cached per
// source URL for the life of the process, so dragging the size slider re-prices
// against an already-parsed mesh and never re-downloads it.
//
// Every number here comes from the quote engine. No price is computed anywhere
// else, in this file or in any frontend module.
