// GET /api/home/:id/stream: the live home, as Server-Sent Events.
//
// Events:
//   graph      the room graph, on open and on every coalesced rebuild
//   status     { status, connected, stale, detail } on open, disconnect, reconnect
//   heartbeat  every 25 s, because idle proxies close silent streams
//
// Four properties this handler exists to guarantee, each of which was a bug
// somewhere before it was a rule:
//
//   1. The first `graph` is sent IMMEDIATELY on open, from whatever the pooled
//      socket already holds. A 3D home that paints only once somebody happens to
//      flip a light is not a live view, it is a blank screen with a promise.
//   2. The graph is never emptied. When the house drops, the last good graph
//      stays and a `status` event marks it stale. The user watches their home go
//      grey; they do not watch it vanish.
//   3. `req.on('close')` unsubscribes and releases the pooled reference. A leaked
//      reference pins a stranger's house open forever, because the idle evictor
//      only touches entries whose refcount has reached zero.
//   4. Two streams on the same home share ONE socket. The pool is keyed by home,
//      so a second subscriber is a second listener on the first connection and
//      never a second WebSocket into somebody's house.
//
// Buffering: `x-accel-buffering: no` and `cache-control: no-store` are load
// bearing in front of a CDN and a reverse proxy. Without them the edge holds
// frames until the response ends, which for a stream is never, and the page
// looks hung while the server believes it is delivering.
