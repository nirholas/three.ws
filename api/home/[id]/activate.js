// POST /api/home/:id/activate, a phrase to a scene the user already built.
//
// Body: { phrase, dryRun, confirmed }
//
// "Good night" is not a feature we invent. It is a scene the user already built,
// in an editor they already know, and this route's whole job is to find it. The
// user's own Bedtime scene knows about the plant light and the fish tank, and no
// amount of reasoning over an entity list will.
//
// `dryRun: true` resolves the phrase and returns the match WITHOUT running it.
// That is not a debugging affordance, it is the voice loop's read-back step: an
// agent that heard "good night" through a microphone should be able to say "I'll
// run your Bedtime scene" and be told which scene that is before anything in the
// house moves.
//
// A phrase that matches nothing is a 200 with `ran: false` and `match: null`,
// never a 404. The house simply has no scene by that name, which is an ordinary
// answer the client renders as a suggestion, not a failure to report.
