// POST /api/home/:id/call, one Home Assistant service call, through the gate.
//
// Body: { domain, service, data, confirmed }
//
// This is the endpoint that can unlock a front door, so the shape of its refusal
// matters more than the shape of its success.
//
// A guarded action with no explicit yes comes back as 409 with the resolved
// action in `pending`. Not 403, which every HTTP client on earth treats as
// terminal and would turn "ask the user" into "give up". Not 200 with an error
// field, which a language model reads as SUCCESS and which is precisely how an
// agent talks itself into believing it locked a door it actually opened. 409 is
// a conflict with the current authorization state, and it is retryable with the
// same body plus a human's yes, which is exactly what this is.
//
// `confirmed: true` represents a person saying yes. It arrives from a client
// where a human pressed something. It is never set from model output, never
// inferred from phrasing, and never defaulted on, which is why it is read as a
// strict `=== true` below rather than as anything truthy: the string "false",
// which is what a form field or a sloppy serializer produces, is truthy in
// JavaScript and would open a door.
//
// Every outcome, including every refusal, writes a home_action_log row. A
// refused unlock is the single most important row in that table: it is the
// evidence that the gate held.
