// /api/home/:id/layout: the authored floorplan for one house.
//
//   GET     the current layout, its version, and what has drifted from the house
//   PUT     write a layout, refusing a stale write with 409 and the current one
//   DELETE  drop it, so the scene returns to the default arrangement
//
// Home Assistant has no geometry, so the arrangement of rooms in the 3D scene is
// either the default grid or something a person drew. This route owns the second
// one. It is never required: no row here is an ordinary state, and the scene
// renders the default grid without it.
//
// Two members can edit the same house. `version` is the whole concurrency story:
// a PUT names the version it loaded, a mismatch is refused with the current
// document attached, and the editor asks the user rather than silently
// discarding somebody's afternoon. Last-write-wins on a timestamp was rejected
// because clock skew between two browsers is real and the loser of a millisecond
// should not lose their work.
