// /api/home, the caller's homes, and the door that adds one.
//
//   GET   list every home this account has connected, credential-free
//   POST  verify a Home Assistant instance for real, then store it
//
// The POST is the only place a Home Assistant long-lived access token ever
// enters the platform, which is why it does three things in a fixed order and
// refuses to reorder them:
//
//   1. Validate the URL shape BEFORE anything opens a socket, so a LAN address
//      is refused with an explanation instead of a fifteen second timeout.
//   2. Open a real connection and MEASURE the instance: version, entity count,
//      areas, floors, and whether the optional Model Context Protocol Server
//      integration answers. Nothing here is inferred from the URL or assumed
//      from a version string. A capability we did not observe is reported as
//      absent, never as present.
//   3. Only then encrypt the token and write the row. A house we could not
//      reach never becomes a stored credential, so the connection list cannot
//      fill up with rows that have never worked.
//
// A home whose `mcp_server` integration is not enabled is NOT an error at any
// point in that sequence. It is an ordinary home, it connects, it stores, and it
// comes back with `capabilities.mcp === false` plus the setting path the user
// would follow to turn it on. Treating a missing optional integration as a
// failure is how a connect screen tells a person their working house is broken.
