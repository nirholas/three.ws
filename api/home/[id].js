// /api/home/:id: one home, and the door that removes it.
//
//   GET     the connection record plus a live room graph snapshot
//   DELETE  disconnect: soft-delete the row and destroy the credential
//
// The GET deliberately answers even when the house is unreachable. A person
// opening their home page while their router is rebooting should see the home
// they connected, the reason it is not answering, and a way to retry, not a 502
// with no context. So the record always comes back at 200 and the graph is
// nullable, with `status` and `status_detail` carrying the truth. A route that
// 502s here would make the whole page an error page over a transient blip.
//
// The DELETE is idempotent by design and returns 200 both times. Disconnecting a
// home twice is not an error; it is a person clicking a button they were not
// sure had worked, and answering the second click with a 404 teaches them that
// the first one broke something.
