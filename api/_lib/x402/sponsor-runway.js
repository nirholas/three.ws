//
// Sponsor fee-wallet RUNWAY: how many days of settling the fee payer can still
// afford, measured from what it actually spent, plus the alert that fires before
// it bites.
//
// Why this module exists
// ----------------------
// The sponsor wallet (X402_FEE_PAYER_SOLANA) pays the SOL fee on every platform
// settle. Below X402_SPONSOR_SOL_FLOOR_LAMPORTS the self-facilitator refuses to
// settle, and buildRequirements() then WITHDRAWS the Solana accept from every 402
// challenge (sponsorKnownBelowFloor(), api/_lib/x402-paid-endpoint.js). The
// outward symptom is not a clean outage: settlements collapse while rail faults
// stay flat, because the Solana-only ring never attempts a payment there is
// nothing to reject. The settle sensor names that cause (`sponsor_floor` in
// ops/x402-settle-health.js), but naming it AFTER the collapse is a post-mortem.
// The runway is the signal that precedes it, and until now it was rendered on a
// dashboard nobody watches at 3am and acted on by nothing.
//
// Two rules the numbers obey
// --------------------------
// 1. BURN IS MEASURED, NEVER REMEMBERED. It comes from `fee_lamports` over
//    successful settles in `x402_self_facilitator_log` across a stated window.
//    The folklore figure carried in old triage notes ("1 to 2 SOL/day") is off by
//    roughly 10x against the measured 0.06 to 0.09 SOL/day (ISSUES.md item 6), and
//    a funding ask sized from it would be wrong by an order of magnitude. Every
//    consumer therefore carries the window alongside the number: a rate without
//    its window is a rumour.
// 2. RUNWAY IS MEASURED TO THE FLOOR, NOT TO ZERO. Settling stops at the floor,
//    so the operationally meaningful figure is (balance minus floor) / burn. The
//    to-zero figure is still reported (`runway_days`) because it is what the
//    board has always shown and what a funding ask is sized against, but the
//    STATUS and the alert key off `runway_days_to_floor`.
//
// Everything here except measureSponsorBurn() is pure, so the thresholds and the
// alert copy are unit-tested without a chain or a database
// (tests/x402-sponsor-runway.test.js).
