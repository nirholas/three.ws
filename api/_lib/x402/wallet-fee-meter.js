// api/_lib/x402/wallet-fee-meter.js
//
// I/O side of the wallet fee governor (wallet-fee-governor.js holds the pure
// math). Builds the `feeMeter` hook the facilitator handler passes into
// settleRingPayment(): before co-signing/broadcasting, the settle path asks
// this meter whether the fee-paying wallet still has daily fee budget left.
//
// Scope: ONLY platform-controlled wallets (ringAllowedAddresses) are governed.
// An external organic buyer self-paying through our facilitator spends its own
// SOL — refusing its settle would be refusing revenue, so unknown wallets are
// always admitted. The same holds for an organic buyer in SPONSOR mode: the fee
// wallet is ours and governed, but the payment is a customer's. The daily budget
// exists to pace our own autonomous traffic, and on 2026-09-21 it refused a
// visitor's $THREE cover charge at the Club door with `fee_runway_exhausted`
// because the ring had already spent the morning's slice. A buyer who is not a
// platform wallet is therefore admitted past the budget (their fee is still
// recorded against it, so our own traffic yields to them, not the reverse).
// Every failure mode in here fails OPEN: the settle path's hard SOL floor
// remains the real protection; the meter is pacing.
//
// Spent-today reads sum `x402_self_facilitator_log.fee_lamports` per fee_payer
// (migration 20260728120000) with a short in-process cache, and each settled
// fee is debited into the cache optimistically so a burst inside one cache
// window still counts against the budget on this instance.

// ── Caller-side admission ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The settle-path meter below runs at the LAST step of the x402 handshake. By the
// time it refuses, the caller has already probed the endpoint for its challenge,
// read the receiver ATA, built and signed a Solana transfer, and paid for a
// facilitator `verify`: which SIMULATES the transaction against an RPC node.
// Every one of those steps is wasted when the wallet's daily fee budget is
// already spent, because the settle is refused at the end regardless.
//
// Measured 2026-08-01: 85,264 of 90,041 daily settle attempts were refused with
// `fee_runway_exhausted`, each having already burned a simulation. That is the
// bulk of ~170k wasted RPC round-trips a day, and it is why the Solana lanes read
// 1/3 serving while the settle rate read 26%.
//
// assessFeeAdmission() answers the same question with the SAME pure math, before
// the caller spends anything, so an exhausted budget short-circuits one call
// instead of paying for a full handshake to be told no at the end. It changes no
// money: the settles it skips were never going to land. Total settled volume is
// still capped by the wallet's funded budget: this removes the waste around that
// cap, it does not raise it.
//
// Fails OPEN everywhere, exactly like the settle-path meter: an ungoverned
// wallet, an unreadable balance, or an unreadable ledger all admit. The settle
// path's meter and its hard SOL floor remain the real protection; a gate that
// refused calls it could not price would be a worse outage than the waste it
// prevents.

// A refusal is stable until a top-up or the UTC-midnight budget reset, so it may
// be cached far longer than an admission (which decays as settles land and spend
// the budget down). One minute collapses a storm while still letting a top-up
// reopen the rail promptly.
