/**
 * Shared lifecycle rules for recurring on-chain payments.
 *
 * Two schedule kinds ride the same rails:
 *   - `agent_subscriptions`: a fixed USDC transfer per period, charged by the
 *     run-subscriptions cron through /api/permissions/redeem.
 *   - EVM DCA schedules: a fixed USDC swap per period, executed by the run-dca
 *     cron through the same relayer. They live in the unified order store
 *     (`orders` rows on network 'evm', see api/_lib/dca-unified.js); the
 *     legacy `dca_strategies` table is only read once, to adopt old rows.
 *
 * Both used to treat every failure identically: pause the schedule and write a
 * raw error string. A one-off RPC blip therefore killed a schedule as
 * permanently as a revoked delegation, and nothing could set it back to
 * 'active'. This module is the single place that decides what a failure means,
 * so the crons, the API and the UI all agree on it.
 *
 * The outcomes:
 *   fatal      the owner has to change something (revoked or expired
 *              delegation, a scope that no longer covers the charge). Retrying
 *              is guaranteed to fail, so the schedule pauses immediately.
 *   retryable  nothing about the schedule is wrong; the attempt did not land
 *              (RPC down, relayer unreachable, wallet short of funds). The
 *              schedule stays active and the next tick tries again, up to
 *              MAX_CONSECUTIVE_FAILURES before it pauses.
 *   ambiguous  the request timed out, so the transfer may or may not be
 *              on-chain. Never retried: the period is consumed and the schedule
 *              pauses for the owner to look at, because a retry here is the one
 *              failure mode that can double-charge.
 *   skipped    the schedule deliberately declined to act this period (a DCA
 *              quote that moved too far between reads). Nothing is wrong, so
 *              the period is simply given up and the next one runs on time.
 *
 * One failure is recorded as retryable but handled apart from it: a
 * platform-side outage (the relayer switched off, or rejecting our own
 * credentials) is nobody's schedule being wrong. Those retry forever without
 * counting toward the pause bound, because pausing every schedule on the
 * platform over one operator config gap would be a far worse outage than the
 * gap itself, and every one of them would then need a manual resume.
