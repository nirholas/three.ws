// three.ws Home health: telling "one person's house is offline" apart from
// "every house went offline", which look identical from a single connection.
//
// Most failures in this lane are not ours. A user's Home Assistant is powered
// off, their token expired, their broadband dropped. Those are per-tenant
// conditions: they must always be visible to that one user, in their own UI and
// their own action log, and they must NEVER page anyone. An operator woken at
// 3am because a stranger unplugged a router stops reading the channel, and then
// the real outage arrives unread.
//
// So every rate here is computed ACROSS TENANTS. One offline house cannot move
// an aggregate over ten homes; a bad deploy, an egress change or a DNS fault
// moves all of them at once, and that is the only shape that alerts.
//
// The one exception is confirmation integrity. A guarded physical action (an
// unlock, a garage door, a disarm) that executed without a human confirmation is
// a Sev 1 at a volume of one row. It has no error budget and no rate: see
// `confirmationIntegrity` below.
//
// Consumed by:
//   - api/_lib/ops/subsystem-health.js → the `home` subsystem in /api/healthz and /api/status
//   - api/cron/home-health-alert.js    → the three alerts
//
// Shaped after api/_lib/ops/index-lag.js: a `read*` that does the IO, a pure
// `*Verdict` that scores it, and a `gather*` that never throws.

 * signature at all, which is why it is measured as a SHAPE over time rather than
 * a threshold.
 *
 * **The obvious signal does not work, and this was measured rather than
 * reasoned.** The plan was to watch the margin between registered subscribers
 * and open streams. Against the real runtime that margin is always zero:
 * `subscribe()` registers the subscriber and admits the stream in the same call,
 * so the two counters move in lockstep by construction and a detector built on
 * their difference can never fire. A run of six deliberately leaked
 * subscriptions produced `margins=[0,0,0]`.
 *
 * What actually leaks is the ABSOLUTE count: subscribers climbing and never
 * coming back down while the number of pooled connections does not grow. Honest
 * traffic fluctuates, because people close tabs. A leak only ever rises.
 *
 * The count alone is not enough either, because many people can legitimately
 * watch one house at once and that also raises subscribers against a flat
 * connection count. So the detector additionally requires more watchers per open
 * connection than a household plausibly has (`LEAK_PER_CONNECTION`), which is
 * where "a family is looking at the same home" stops being the likely
 * explanation and "nobody is releasing" starts.
 *
 * The margin is still recorded, because a NON-zero one is a different bug worth
 * seeing: a stream admitted without a subscriber, or the reverse.
