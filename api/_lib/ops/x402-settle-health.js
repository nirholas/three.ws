// @ts-check
// x402 settle-success-rate sensor — the health signal the July 2026 502 wave
// proved was missing.
//
// The existing checks answer "is the ring ARMED?" (checkRing → invariants,
// checkX402Config → pay-to + fee payer present) and "is discovery UP?"
// (uptime-check probes /.well-known/x402.json). All three read healthy while a
// third of real settlements silently fail: from 2026-07-09 to 2026-07-17 the
// self-facilitator rejected ~300 settles/6h (same-signature collisions surfaced
// as `http_502`) yet every sensor above stayed green because the ring was
// configured, discovery answered 200, and *some* payments still landed. Eight
// days, no page. This module closes that hole by reading the only authoritative
// signal — the outcome the ring records for every paid call in
// `x402_autonomous_log` — and reporting the settle SUCCESS RATE.
//
// What counts, and the nuance that makes the signal usable
// --------------------------------------------------------
// `success=true, amount_atomic>0`  → a settlement LANDED (the numerator).
// A failure only counts against the rate when it is a PAYMENT-RAIL fault:
// facilitator/settle 5xx, a 402 (payment rejected), or an RPC/broadcast/confirm
// fault. Everything else the ring records is deliberately excluded, because the
// log is noisy with things that are NOT settle failures:
//   - caller/endpoint mismatches — http_400/404/405/409 (the ring POSTing to a
//     GET-only endpoint, or passing args a handler rejects). ~800/6h in prod:
//     including them would peg the sensor red and bury a real settle regression.
//   - benign guards — cap_would_exceed, insufficient_payer_usdc, breaker_tripped,
//     wallet_unconfigured, no_solana_accept: the ring CHOOSING not to pay. Ring
//     funding has its own monitor (x402/wallet-balance-monitor.js).
//   - downstream pipeline notes — *_calls_failed, config_missing: the payment
//     settled (or was never attempted); the failure is in value extraction.
// The fault set is an allowlist of rail faults, kept broad on the rail dimension
// (any 5xx, any RPC/broadcast/settle/confirm/simulation/timeout signature) so a
// NEW settle failure mode is caught without a code change — exactly what the 502
// wave needed. When a genuinely new benign reason starts showing up as a fault,
// add it to EXCLUDED_HINT and the caller docs, the same learn-once loop as the
// triage monitor's KNOWN_SIGNATURES.
//
// The window is 3h: the ring settles in bursts (an idle hour can hold zero
// settlements while it waits on funding or a settle-tick), so a short window
// reads `unknown` constantly. 3h reliably carries hundreds of attempts, smooths
// the bursts, and still surfaces a regression within hours — against an 8-day
// blind spot, decisive. Below MIN_ATTEMPTS the verdict is `unknown` (neutral,
// never pages): too little settling to judge is not a fault.
//
// The blind spot `unknown` opens, and why the governor count closes it
// --------------------------------------------------------------------
// "Too few attempts to judge" is the right verdict for a quiet ring and the
// WRONG one for a throttled one, and the two are identical in this log until you
// count the throttle. Since the wallet fee governor gained a caller-side
// admission check, a fee wallet with no daily budget left makes the ring SKIP
// its paid calls (reason `fee_runway_exhausted`) instead of settling them. Those
// skips are correctly not rail faults (nothing broke, we chose not to spend),
// but they also empty the numerator AND the denominator, so a rail that is
// 100% paced shut reads exactly like a rail nobody used. Measured on production
// 2026-08-01, before the admission check existed and while the same refusal
// still came back as a 502: 85,265 governed refusals against 562 rail-shaped
// failures, a settle rate of 25.9%, and a hint that sent the reader to the
// facilitator for a funding problem. `governorSkips` is counted separately here
// so the sensor can say "paced, top the fee wallet up" in both regimes.
