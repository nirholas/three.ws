// Turning a paid knock into a person walking on screen.
//
// One function, called by both lanes (the x402 endpoint for priced doors and
// /api/knock/send for free ones), so a knock behaves identically however it
// was paid for. The order matters:
//
//   1. refuse early  -- closed door, daily cap, block list. Nothing is charged
//      by this module, but the paid lane calls checkDoor() BEFORE the 402
//      challenge is issued, so a refused knock never takes money.
//   2. write the companion event  -- this is what makes the avatar walk on.
//      Its importance comes from the price, so the sender's own money decides
//      whether the owner is interrupted (api/_lib/knock/policy.js).
//   3. write the knock row, linked to that event, so the inbox and the
//      companion feed are two views of one thing.
//   4. notify  -- 'knock_received' rides the normal preference matrix, which
//      is what puts the line in the bell, the push, and the corner avatar on
//      whatever page the owner happens to be on.
//
// Steps 2 and 4 are best-effort: a knock that has been paid for is recorded
// even if the companion feed or the bell is having a bad minute. Losing the
// delivery animation is a degraded experience; losing a paid message is theft.
