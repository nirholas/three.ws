// Canonical server-side text completion + the platform's LLM provider policy.
//
// Policy (do not re-implement per endpoint — that is how this drifted before):
//
//   • FREE PROVIDERS FIRST, ALWAYS. Groq, Cerebras, OpenRouter (paid model,
//     then the :free variant on the same key), Gemini AI Studio, and NVIDIA
//     NIM are platform-funded free tiers — the server holds those keys and
//     callers use them at zero marginal cost. OVH AI Endpoints and Pollinations
//     need no key at all (anonymous/keyless tiers) and are always in the chain,
//     so llmConfigured() is never false even with zero env vars set. They form
//     the default chain, tried in order, 70B-class models before any capability
//     step-down, and every flow must survive on them alone: the paid keys in
//     prod are routinely invalid or out of quota, so a chain that depends on
//     them fails.
//
//   • THE FREE TIER KEEPS GROWING. SambaNova, Mistral (Experiment tier),
//     Z.AI GLM Flash, Cloudflare Workers AI, and SiliconFlow are optional
//     keyed rungs (each skipped when its env var is unset), and LLM7.io is a
//     second keyless anonymous rung alongside OVH and Pollinations. Every new
//     free provider is an independent quota pool, so adding one raises the
//     ceiling of traffic the platform serves at zero marginal cost.
//
//   • VERTEX GEMINI IS THE RELIABILITY ANCHOR. When GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT is
//     set (every Cloud Run deploy), Gemini Flash-Lite on Vertex — service
//     account auth, GCP-credit billing, no third-party quota — sits between
//     the free tiers and the paid tail, so exhausting every free quota at
//     once still cannot produce an error.
//
//   • Paid server keys are the LAST-RESORT tier, automatically. When
//     ANTHROPIC_API_KEY or OPENAI_API_KEY is configured, those providers are
//     appended to the tail of EVERY chain so a request that exhausted the
//     free providers still succeeds instead of erroring. They never lead, and
//     no flow hard-fails when they are absent or out of quota.
//
//   • BYOK is the one exception to free-first: a caller-supplied
//     `anthropicKey` (e.g. an agent owner's own key) leads the chain — that's
//     the caller's explicit model choice on the caller's own billing — still
//     degrading to the free chain on failure.
//
// Consolidated from the multi-provider fallback that already lived in
// api/persona/extract.js and api/persona/preview.js.
