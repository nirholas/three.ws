// Lightweight liveness/warmth for the self-host GPU lanes — the signal the
// health-aware router consults so a cold or down worker is skipped BEFORE submit.
//
// forge-health.js already runs a heavy, everything-at-once health report (every
// backend + the limiter + the world + LLM providers, 60s cache) for the status
// dashboard. The router needs something cheaper and tighter: just "can our own
// GPU workers serve a generation right now, and are they warm?" — answered from
// a short per-instance cache so the hot generation path pays no probe latency in
// the common case.
//
// Two independent signals fold into each lane's status:
//   1. A recent submit failure recorded a cooldown in the SHARED cache
//      (provider-health.js) — cross-instance memory that a lane just failed, so
//      every instance skips it until the window expires. This is authoritative:
//      a cooled lane is reported `down` without spending a probe.
//   2. A cheap authenticated GET against the worker root. Cloud Run answers
//      anything <500 the moment a container is up and routable; unreachable /
//      timeout / 5xx means a submit would fail. Round-trip latency doubles as a
//      warmth signal — a scale-to-zero container that just spun up answers slowly.
//
// Only self-host (provider === 'gcp') lanes are probed; the free external lanes
// (NVIDIA NIM, HuggingFace) carry their own circuit breakers in the handler and
// are reported `unknown` here unless a cooldown marks them down, so the router
// never blocks on telemetry it doesn't have.
//
// Everything is best-effort and fail-open: a probe error or cache miss degrades
// to `unknown`, which the router treats as usable — exactly the pre-health
// behaviour.
