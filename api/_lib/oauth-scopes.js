// OAuth scope sets, in one place, because two surfaces have to agree on them.
//
// A dynamically-registered MCP client learns what it may ask for by following
// the chain the 401 hands it: `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer resource_metadata=...`
// points at /.well-known/oauth-protected-resource (RFC 9728), and the client
// registers for the scopes that document lists. So the scope list published
// there and the scope list the registration endpoint actually keeps
// (`filterRegisterableScope`) are the same contract seen from two sides: any
// scope missing from the metadata is a scope no discovery-driven client will
// ever request, and any scope listed there but dropped at registration is a
// promise the server breaks.
//
// They drifted once already. The wallet/services scopes were added to
// registration to make the agent-wallet MCP server (api/mcp-agent) reachable,
// and the published metadata kept advertising the original eight, so a client
// that discovered its scopes the documented way still could not reach
// wallet_status, pay_and_call, provision_wallet or monetize_endpoint. Both
// sides now read this array, and tests/api/oauth-scope-discovery.test.js
// pins them together.
