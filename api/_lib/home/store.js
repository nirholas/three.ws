// The connection store: where a user's homes live, and the only module that
// ever touches a home's credential.
//
// Everything here takes and returns plain objects. No HTTP, no `res`, no Home
// Assistant. The runtime (api/_lib/home/runtime.js) and the endpoints
// (api/home/*) sit above it, and neither of them is allowed to write SQL
// against these tables or to read a credential column.
//
// Two invariants this module enforces so its callers cannot get them wrong:
//
//   1. A connection row is NEVER returned with `access_token_enc` on it. The
//      safe projection is built in SQL (SAFE_COLUMNS below), so a new caller
//      cannot accidentally spread a credential into a response body.
//   2. Ownership is a `where user_id = $1` inside every query, never a check in
//      JavaScript after the row is already in hand. A miss and a
//      wrong-owner both return null, so the store never leaks the existence of
//      another user's home.
//
// `getDecryptedToken` is the single exception to (1), which is exactly why it is
// its own export with its own name: every call site that can hold a plaintext
// key to someone's front door is one grep away.
