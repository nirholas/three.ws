/**
 * What a plan lets a house do, and the one thing no plan may ever stop it doing.
 *
 * ── The cost model, because it decides the shape of everything below ─────────
 *
 * The expensive thing in this lane is not an action. It is a HELD SOCKET. A
 * house that is connected and idle occupies heap on a Cloud Run instance for
 * the entire month whether or not anybody speaks to it, so a plan metered only
 * on actions would charge nothing for the dominant cost. That is why `homes`
 * is the first dimension here and why it is the one enforced at acquisition.
 *
 * Measured, not assumed (scripts/measure-home-entitlement-cost.mjs, 2026-09-03,
 * 16 real WebSocket connections against a real Home Assistant with 125
 * entities, priced against the production service shape and the live Cloud Run
 * SKUs from Google's own billing catalog):
 *
 *   302 KB heap / 262 KB RSS per live connection   →  $0.0155 per home per month
 *   23,036-byte room graph per stream event        →  $0.0066 per open stream per month
 *   an agent turn on the default free LLM chain    →  $0
 *   the same turn on Claude Sonnet 5               →  $0.0228
 *
 * The finding that number produces is worth stating plainly: **one agent turn on
 * a paid model costs weeks of holding that house's socket** ($0.0228 against
 * $0.0155 a month, so about six weeks for one sentence). A re-measurement on
 * 2026-09-09 reproduced the heap and stream figures and put resident memory
 * higher, at $0.0738 per home per month; even there a Sonnet turn is nine days
 * of socket, so the shape below holds across the range. See
 * docs/home-plans.md. The free
 * tier can therefore carry a genuinely connected home, and the limits below are
 * generous on connections and careful on paid-model turns, which is the opposite
 * of what the cost model looked like before it was measured.
 *
 * ── The five commitments ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * These are product commitments, not implementation details, and the first and
 * last are the ones to fight for if anybody pushes back:
 *
 *   1. A LIMIT NEVER BLOCKS A SAFETY ACTION. Over quota, past due, downgraded,
 *      suspended: a user can still lock their door, close their garage, close a
 *      water valve and arm their alarm. The safe direction is always free. A
 *      product that will not let someone lock up because they hit a quota is
 *      indefensible, and `isQuotaExempt` below is where that is enforced rather
 *      than promised. It delegates to the home-bridge package's own
 *      `isSafetyAction`, so the list of safe moves is a fact about Home
 *      Assistant kept in one place, never a copy in the billing code.
 *
 *   2. DOWNGRADING NEVER SILENTLY DISCONNECTS A HOUSE. Connections over the new
 *      limit are marked inactive with a written explanation and the user picks
 *      which to keep. Nothing is deleted, no credential is scrubbed, no action
 *      log loses its lineage. See `planDowngrade` and `applyDowngrade`.
 *
 *   3. A QUOTA IS SHOWN BEFORE IT IS HIT, on the manage surface, with the reset
 *      date. `describeEntitlements` returns exactly what that surface renders.
 *
 *   4. ENTERPRISE LIMITS ARE CONFIGURABLE PER ACCOUNT, not hardcoded, because
 *      that is what the sales conversation is. `home_plan_overrides` carries
 *      them and raising one is a row, never a deploy.
 *
 *   5. NOTHING ABOUT THE GATE IS A PAID FEATURE. Confirmations, the audit log's
 *      integrity and the role system's safety properties exist on every tier.
 *      Selling safety would be wrong and it would also make the free tier a
 *      liability. There is deliberately no dimension below for any of them, and
 *      there must never be one.
 *
 * ── Where the numbers come from ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * This module does NOT invent a fourth entitlement system. It reads the two that
 * already exist:
 *
 *   api/_lib/account-tier.js  the membership modes (user, beta, pro, holder,
 *                             three-dimensional) and the resolver over them.
 *   api/_lib/three-tier.js    the $THREE holder ladder and its `rateMultiplier`,
 *                             which is already defined as "scales free quotas".
 *
 * A member wears several badges at once, so a limit is the MAX across every
 * active badge, never the primary badge's alone: a Pro subscriber who also holds
 * $THREE must not lose Pro's connection limit because `holder` outranks `pro`.
 *
 * Every number is env-overridable (`HOME_LIMIT_<TIER>_<DIMENSION>`), so applying
 * an owner-approved price is a config change on a running service and not a
 * deploy. The defaults below are a PROPOSAL: see docs/home-plans.md.
