// Households: who is in this home, what they may do in it, and what they may see.
//
// This module is the single authority on that question. Every surface that acts
// on a home (the connection store's reads, the bridge runtime's acquire, the
// room graph projection, the physical-action gate, the confirm endpoint, the
// grant and layout writers, the chat tools and the MCP tools) resolves the
// caller through `requireMembership` and branches on what it returns. None of
// them keeps its own copy of the rules, and none of them falls back to
// "or the connection's user_id is the caller": a role system with a bypass is
// decoration, and the bypass is always the path an attacker takes.
//
// The rule the whole design exists for:
//
//   A guest can never confirm a guarded action.
//
// A house sitter should be able to turn the lights on and should not be able to
// authorise unlocking the front door. Home Assistant's own `intent__HassTurnOff`
// performs an unlock on a lock, so "turn something off" and "open the building"
// are the same call with different targets. `confirm` is the line between them
// and it is drawn here, server side, once.
//
// Scope is enforced here too, for the same reason. A guest given the kitchen can
// read the kitchen. The rooms they were not given are removed from the graph
// before it is serialized, not hidden by the client, because a room whose state
// reached the browser has already been disclosed.
