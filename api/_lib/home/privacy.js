// The Home lane's data inventory, and the code that acts on it.
//
// Everything three.ws stores about a person's house is enumerated once, here,
// in INVENTORY. That list is not documentation of the code: it IS the code.
// The privacy endpoint renders it, the export walks it, the deletion walks it,
// and tests/home-privacy.test.js re-derives the set of home_* tables from the
// migration files and fails if one of them is missing from it. A data class
// nobody wrote down is the failure this structure exists to prevent, so adding
// a table to this campaign without adding a row here breaks the build.
//
// The promise this module keeps, and the reason it can keep it
// ----------------------------------------------------------
// **Entity states are never persisted.** Not the room graph, not the entity
// list, not a history of which light was on when. Those live in the bridge
// runtime's memory and die with the instance. A stored record of "the bedroom
// light went on at 23:14" is an occupancy log for a building, and this campaign
// does not create one: read the schema and there is nowhere for it to go. The
// completeness test asserts that too, by checking every persisted home table
// against this list.
//
// Voice audio is stored nowhere, ever. A transcript lives in the conversation
// turn that produced it and is gone with it.
//
// Deletion vs revoke
// ------------------
// `revokeConnection` in store.js is a DISCONNECT: it scrubs the credential and
// keeps the row, so an owner can still answer "what did my agent do in my house
// last Tuesday" about a house they have since unplugged. That is the right
// default and it is not deletion. `deleteHome` here is the other verb: the row
// and everything that points at it go, and nothing is left to read.
