// The bridge runtime: one pool of live Home Assistant connections per process.
//
// `packages/home-bridge` opens one WebSocket per HomeBridge and holds it. This
// module decides who holds those sockets, for how long, and what happens when
// the house, the credential, or the container goes away.
//
// The three facts about our own deployment that shape every choice here were
// read off the running service, not assumed
// (`gcloud run services describe three-ws-api --region us-central1`):
//
//   * `minScale=6`, `maxScale=100`. There are always several instances and any
//     one of them may be recycled at any time.
//   * `sessionAffinity=false`. Two requests from the same browser land on
//     arbitrary instances, so a pooled socket is NEVER guaranteed to be there
//     for the next call. It is a cache with a good hit rate inside one request
//     and across the life of one SSE stream, and nothing more.
//   * `cpu-throttling=true`. Outside a request an instance gets close to no CPU,
//     so a background timer fires late or not at all and a held socket stops
//     draining frames. Eviction therefore runs on a timer AND opportunistically
//     on every acquire, and a pooled graph is always treated as possibly stale.
//
// The consequence, stated once so no caller has to rediscover it: the house is
// the source of truth, this pool is a cache, and a cold instance reopening in a
// few hundred milliseconds is the normal path rather than a failure.
