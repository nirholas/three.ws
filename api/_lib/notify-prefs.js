// preference-center API, the push fan-out, and the email gating.
//
// A notification has a `type` (e.g. 'skill_purchased'). Types roll up into a
// small set of user-facing CATEGORIES. The user controls, per category, which
// CHANNELS deliver it. Channels: in_app (the bell inbox), push (Web Push),
// email (Resend transactional), telegram (per-account bot alerts), avatar (the
// corner companion walks on and says it out loud, see src/notification-herald.js).
//
// Preferences are stored sparsely in notification_preferences.prefs as
//   { categories: { sales: { push: false }, ... }, telegram_chat_id: '123' }
// Any key a user hasn't touched falls back to DEFAULTS below — so new
// categories light up without a backfill, and a user with no row at all gets
// sensible behaviour.
