/**
 * Recording pipeline — one-call health of the whole data→signal→trade loop.
 *
 *   GET /api/pipeline?network=mainnet
 *
 * The platform's edge is a closed feedback loop. A long-lived worker
 * (workers/agent-sniper) sits on the pump.fun new-mint feed and records every
 * launch's first-90s signals; cron jobs then score conviction, fold a wallet
 * reputation graph, label outcomes, and train per-signal weights; armed agents
 * trade on the result. Each link lives in a different table, so "is the loop
 * actually running?" otherwise takes six queries across six surfaces.
 *
 * This endpoint answers it in one round-trip. Every stage is queried
 * independently and degrades on its own — a table that doesn't exist yet
 * (fresh DB) or a worker that has never booted reports an honest zero/offline
 * state rather than failing the whole response. The frontend (/pipeline)
 * renders this as a live flow: all-dark until the recorder boots, then lighting
 * up stage by stage as data flows downstream.
 *
 * Public + IP rate-limited — pipeline health carries no secrets and the point
 * of a status surface is that anyone can see whether the platform is alive.
