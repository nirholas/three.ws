// @ts-check
// GET /api/cron/reconstruct-sweep — completion backstop for selfie/prompt →
// avatar jobs.
//
// A reconstruct job is advanced by the browser: /create/selfie polls
// /api/avatars/regenerate-status, and each poll pulls provider status and runs
// the finalize stages. Close the tab and that engine stops — the worker
// finishes the GLB and writes it to GCS, but no one ever collects it, so the
// job row sits at 'queued'/'running' forever and the user's library never
// receives the avatar they made. Production had rows stranded this way going
// back a month (12 at the time this shipped), each one a real person whose
// avatar silently vanished.
//
// This sweep is the server-side driver the flow was missing: every few minutes
// it finds reconstruct jobs that have gone quiet, asks the provider for their
// real status, and runs the SAME finalize stages the browser poll would have —
// so an abandoned job still lands in the user's library, exactly as if they had
// kept the tab open. It mirrors auto-rig-sweep.js, which plays this role for
// the rerig lane; the shared stages in reconstruct-finalize.js are what keep
// the two completion paths from drifting.
//
// Scope is deliberately platform-providers-only (gcp / replicate / huggingface).
// BYOK jobs (meshy, tripo) authenticate with the *user's* key, which the status
// poll resolves from the request context; a cron has no user context, so those
// jobs stay browser-driven and the age reaper below is their only backstop.
// They are a rounding error in practice (1 of the last ~100 reconstruct jobs).
