// @ts-check
// GET /api/cron/db-retention — keep the database under its storage cap.
//
// Why this exists
// ---------------
// The platform runs on a Neon branch with a hard project-size cap (512 MB on the
// free tier). Two families of tables grow without bound and, left alone, march the
// branch straight into that cap — at which point Postgres raises SQLSTATE 53100
// ("could not extend file because project size limit … exceeded") and every WRITE
// path starts failing (the production incident this cron closes out):
//
//   1. The pump.fun intel firehose. `pump_coin_intel` ingests ~15–20k new mints a
//      day (≈30 MB/day), and its mint-keyed satellites (`pump_coin_wallets`,
//      `coin_smart_money`, `smart_money_scored`, `pump_coin_outcomes`,
//      `oracle_conviction`, `oracle_conviction_history`) grow in lockstep — ~60 MB
//      a day across the family. Nothing pruned it, so it accreted until the branch
//      was full.
//   2. `avatar_regen_jobs`. Each reconstruct job's `params` carries the multi-MB
//      base64 SOURCE images. The live path drops them once a job leaves
//      reconstruction (reconstruct-finalize.js), but terminal (done/failed) jobs
//      that took another route kept them — 346 rows were holding 43 MB.
//
// What it does
// ------------
// Runs on a schedule and, idempotently + bounded so a single tick can never run
// away past the function's maxDuration:
//
//   A. FIREHOSE RETENTION. Deletes every mint (and its satellite rows) older than
//      the retention window. The window self-tunes: normally PUMP_INTEL_RETENTION_
//      DAYS, but when the branch is over the high-water mark it tightens to
//      PUMP_INTEL_MIN_RETENTION_DAYS so the cap is never actually hit. This is the
//      self-healing valve — it sheds the oldest firehose data under storage
//      pressure and relaxes again once space is reclaimed. The engine's own judge
//      window (smart-money-rollup.js) resolves coins within a day or two of launch,
//      so a multi-day window keeps everything load-bearing; wallet reputation
//      (`wallet_reputation`, wallet-keyed, the durable output) and the win/loss
//      ground truth (`pumpfun_graduations`) are never touched.
//   A4. AUTOPILOT RUN LOGS. The buyback/distribute crons record one row per coin
//      per tick. Successful runs carry a tx_signature and are kept forever; the
//      `failed`/`skipped` diagnostic rows are pruned on the firehose window.
//   B. AVATAR JOB HYGIENE. Strips the base64 source images from terminal jobs past
//      a day old, and deletes terminal jobs past 30 days.
//   C. VACUUM. Plain VACUUM on the tables it pruned so the freed pages become
//      reusable and Neon's storage GC can return them.
//   D. COMPACTION. Plain VACUUM never shrinks the relation FILES, so on Neon
//      pg_database_size stays high after a prune and the storage-pressure gate
//      (isStoragePressured / requireWriteCapacity) can latch permanently: the
//      July 2026 recurrence had 770 MB of dead file space across the pruned
//      tables while every write-heavy cron sat skipped. When a tick starts
//      under pressure, this step measures reclaimable space per managed table
//      (pgstattuple_approx) and VACUUM FULLs the worst offenders, smallest
//      first and bounded per tick, so the file space actually returns and the
//      gate unlatches without a human.
//   E. HOME ACTION-LOG RETENTION. home_action_log is the "what did my agent do in
//      my house" trail, and read the other way round it is a behavioural record
//      of a household: when someone came home, which rooms they lit, what time
//      the bedroom light went off. Its window is therefore NOT a platform
//      constant and NOT tunable by an env var here. It is per home and it is
//      the owner's, stored on home_connections.action_log_retention_days
//      (90 days by default). This step joins the log against its own home's
//      setting so the whole policy stays in the database. Deliberately exempt
//      from the storage-pressure valve in both directions: shortening someone's
//      audit trail because our disk is full is not our call to make, and the
//      rows are small enough that they cannot be the reason it is full.
//      See docs/home-privacy.md and api/_lib/home/privacy.js.
//
// DELETE (not UPDATE) is used for the firehose because DELETE settles xmax in place
// and does NOT extend a relation file — it therefore succeeds even AT the cap,
// where an UPDATE (which writes a new tuple version, needing a fresh page) would
// itself fail with 53100. The image-strip UPDATE is guarded for the same reason.
//
// Everything here operates on the platform's OWN runtime launch/intel records at
// runtime and hardcodes no specific mint — generic retention plumbing, not an
// endorsement of any coin.

//   - x402_autonomous_log: one row per autonomous x402 call, success AND
//     failure, with jsonb response payloads. Money-adjacent (tx signatures),
//     so it keeps the audit ledger's longer window.
//   - sniper_coin_sentiment / token_intel_risk: keyed (mint, network) so they
//     grow with the mint universe; their gates treat stale rows as absent, so
//     rows past the firehose window are dead weight.
//   - x402_spent_payments: one small row per honoured x402 payment proof, the
//     durable replay guard behind api/_lib/x402/spent-payments.js. Its window is
//     `spent` — FIXED at 90 days and deliberately exempt from the storage-
//     pressure valve, because shortening it is exactly what re-opens the replay

// It is excluded because /api/x402-ring aggregates it with NO time filter for
// its `lifetime` period (api/x402-ring.js, sinceFor() returns null), so any
// retention window silently shrinks published lifetime settlement and fee
// totals. Every other reader is short-window (healthz 24h, fee-audit and
// wallet-fee-meter current-day, ring-reconciliation LOOKBACK_HOURS,
// sponsor-runway X402_SPONSOR_BURN_WINDOW_DAYS), so a window is technically
// safe for them. Pruning it is therefore a product decision about the public
// revenue figures, not a mechanical retention one: get owner sign-off on what
// `lifetime` should mean (and roll the pruned totals into a summary row first)
// before adding it here.
