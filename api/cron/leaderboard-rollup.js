// GET /api/cron/leaderboard-rollup - daily top-10 badge sweep for the
// cross-surface leaderboard (prompt 06 of the user-value pack).
//
// The leaderboard itself (GET /api/leaderboard/unified) is read live - none of
// its five metrics need a rollup table, the underlying queries are cheap
// aggregates the same way /api/walk/leaderboard's all-time window already is.
// The ONE thing that genuinely needs a daily cadence is the "top10_<metric>"
// badge: a placement earned today shouldn't quietly stop being true if the
// user's rank slips tomorrow, so it has to be captured at a point in time
// rather than recomputed live. This cron is that point in time - once daily,
// walk the top 10 of each metric and award the badge to whoever is there right
// now. Idempotent (user_badges is unique on user_id+code), so a user who holds
// top-10 for a week earns the badge once, on day one.
