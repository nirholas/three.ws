// GET /api/cron/forge-seed-cron — per-minute cron that grows the forge gallery

// user account with an OG single-word username.
//
// Every invocation does two things in parallel and returns immediately — it
// never waits for a generation to finish, keeping execution well under 60 s:
//
//   1. Advance: move every open seed job one step along the pipeline. No step
//      ever blocks on the next, so a tick stays short no matter how slow a lane
//      is. The states, in order:
//
//        pending   → poll /api/forge; a finished mesh becomes `generated`
//        generated → run the catalog quality gate (api/_lib/seed-quality.js).
//                    A reject is quarantined under forge/rejected/ and never
//                    published; a keeper either goes to `rigging` or straight
//                    to publish.
//        rigging    → poll the auto-rig job; publish the rigged mesh when it
//                    lands, and publish the static keeper if the rig failed
//                    (a gated keeper is never thrown away over a rig fault).
//        done / rejected / failed / gate_error are terminal. A gate that could
//        not RUN is not a verdict: the row stays in `generated` and later ticks
//        retry it, reaching gate_error only after GATE_MAX_ATTEMPTS.
//
//   2. Start: pick the next unused prompt(s) from the library, claim an OG
//      username for a new user, submit a draft-tier forge job under that user's
//      client id, record the job so the next tick can poll it.
//
// Lane: the submit names no backend, so /api/forge's own free-first resolver
// picks it: which, with FORGE_SELFHOST_PRIMARY=1, is our own Cloud Run GPU
// fleet ahead of the hosted NVIDIA NIM allocation. Whichever lane runs, the
// backend is recorded on the job row and asserted free: a seed job must never
// silently spend on a paid third-party lane (see assertFreeBackend).
// maxPending() caps in-flight jobs so a slow lane never builds debt.
//
// ── Env knobs (every one defaults to the historical behaviour) ───────────────
//   SEED_CRON_BATCH        jobs to start per tick (default 1). Paced two at a
//                          time: submitting a whole batch at once is how the
//                          garment-forge runs used to silently drop jobs.
//   SEED_CRON_MAX_PENDING  in-flight ceiling (default 3 × batch).
//   SEED_CRON_VISION       '1' enables the render + Vertex judge stage of the
//                          quality gate inside the cron. Off by default: the
//                          function has a hard 70 s wall (vercel.json) and a
//                          history of 504s when a phase overruns, while a render
//                          plus two judge calls costs 10-20 s. The mesh stage of
//                          the gate always runs — it is deterministic, local, and
//                          costs only the GLB fetch. The bulk runner
//                          (scripts/gcp/seed-avatars.mjs) runs both.
//   SEED_CRON_VISION_MS    budget for the vision stage (default 20 000 ms).
//   SEED_CRON_GATE         jobs to gate per tick (default 2). Each costs one GLB
//                          fetch plus a mesh parse, so the ceiling keeps the
//                          tick inside its wall when a burst finishes at once.
//   SEED_CRON_RIG          routes accepted avatars through the auto-rigger before
//                          publishing, so catalog entries arrive animation-ready
//                          instead of driven by the retarget fallback. ON by
//                          default since 2026-09-09; set it to '0' to publish
//                          static meshes again. A rig fault, or a rig that stops
//                          answering (RIG_STALL_MS), publishes the gated keeper
//                          static rather than losing it.
