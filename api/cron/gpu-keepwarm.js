// @ts-check
// GET /api/cron/gpu-keepwarm: hold the scale-to-zero GPU workers open during
// peak hours so a user's first generation of the hour does not pay a cold start.
//
// A Cloud Run GPU service with minScale=0 releases its container after an idle
// window, and the next request pays the worker's full spin-up budget (45s for
// TripoSG, 60s for TRELLIS, 75s for Hunyuan3D, per BACKENDS.coldStartSeconds in
// api/_lib/forge-tiers.js). A cheap authenticated GET every 10 minutes keeps the
// container resident, which is strictly cheaper than raising minScale because it
// only spends GPU during the hours people actually generate.
//
// WHY THIS IS AN ALLOWLIST AND NOT "every worker with minScale=0":
// Cloud Run GPU quota is per accelerator AND per region, and it caps CONCURRENT
// INSTANCES, not services. In us-central1 the granted NvidiaL4 no-zonal quota is
// 3, and the always-on floors (model-trellis minScale=1, model-rig minScale=1)
// already hold 2 of them. Pinning a third L4 worker warm would leave zero spare,
// so model-trellis (the workhorse lane, minScale 1 / maxScale 3) could never
// burst above its floor. Trading the primary lane's burst headroom for a
// fallback lane's cold start is a bad deal, so an L4 worker in us-central1 is
// only listed here once that quota grant grows. Lanes in their own region, or on
// an accelerator with spare quota, carry no such contention and are warmed now.
//
// Set FORGE_KEEPWARM_LANES (comma-separated lane ids) to override the default
// set without a deploy, which is the one-flag change to make when quota lands.
// An id in that list that matches no lane is reported as unknown_lanes and drops
// the tick's `ok` to false, so a typo cannot silently warm nothing.
