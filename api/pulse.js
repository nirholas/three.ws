// GET /api/pulse — the Money Pulse: a real, platform-wide stream of public
// wallet activity across every three.ws agent.
//
// EVERY row is a real event with an explorer-verifiable signature (or a real
// launch record). There are NO synthetic events — if the platform is quiet, the
// feed is honestly empty.
//
// Sources (all real):
//   · agent_custody_events — tips received (event_type='tip'), trades + snipes
//     (event_type='spend', category in 'trade'/'snipe'), and agent-to-agent
//     payments (category='x402'). These are already-public, on-chain movements.
//   · pump_agent_mints — coins launched by an agent.
//   · skill_purchases — real marketplace purchases (skill / time-pass) confirmed
//     on-chain and settled in $THREE. Surfaced as 'purchase' beats the instant a
//     sale lands, straight from the authoritative purchase ledger.
//
// Privacy is load-bearing (see prompts/agent-wallets/07): private withdrawals,
// spend-limit changes, key-recovery and vanity-swap custody events are OWNER-ONLY
// and NEVER appear here. The global feed also honours each agent's is_public flag
// and the per-agent `meta.pulse_opt_out` toggle (owner-controlled, server-side).
//
// Views:
//   GET /api/pulse                       — global live feed (keyset paginated)
