// x402 Preflight: MCP tool.
//
//   • x402_preflight(origin, network?): FREE, read-only, public. Fetches any
//     x402 seller's signed payability attestation, verifies the ed25519
//     signature, the expiry and the subject, and answers the only question that
//     matters before an agent spends: can this seller actually settle?
//
// This is the conversational surface of the same format the SDK and the CLI
// consume. An agent about to pay for a service can ask first, in one free call,
// and get a verdict it can act on: pay, pay on a different rail, or come back
// later. No wallet, no payment, no account, so it ships on the free track.
//
// The verification runs HERE, on the fetched bytes, using the same verifier the
// browser SDK uses. The tool never relays a seller's claim unchecked: an
// attestation that does not verify is reported as unverified, not as an outage
// and not as health.
//
// Spec: specs/x402-preflight.md. Client: packages/x402-preflight.
