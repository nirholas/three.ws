// GET /api/x402/runway-lab
//
// The live seed for /economy-lab: everything the settle path's admission
// control depends on, read from the systems that actually enforce it.
//
// Nothing here is modelled or estimated where a real reading exists:
//
//   • fee wallet + hard floor  → ring-allowlist.js ringRoleWallets() and
//                                self-facilitator.js SPONSOR_SOL_FLOOR_LAMPORTS,
//                                the same constants the settle path enforces.
//   • live SOL balance         → Solana RPC through the platform's lane-failover
//                                connection, not a cached number.
//   • governor config          → wallet-fee-governor.js walletFeeGovernorConfig()
//                                over the running process env, so the lab shows
//                                what THIS deploy is configured with.
//   • spent today              → x402_self_facilitator_log, the exact SUM the
//                                meter itself runs (wallet-fee-meter.js).
//   • fee per settle + demand  → observed from the same log over 24h, so the
//                                projection starts from measured behaviour
//                                rather than a guessed arrival rate.
//   • refusal mix              → reject_reason histogram, bucketed by cause, so
//                                the page can show what the rail is ACTUALLY
//                                refusing next to what the model predicts.
//
// Read-only and unauthenticated by design: every field is already public
// through /api/x402-ring and /api/x402-status (balances of platform wallets,
// config thresholds, aggregate settle counts). No secret, no key material, and
// no per-user data is reachable from here.
