// POST /api/x402/print-order
//
// An AI agent pays, and a physical object gets manufactured and shipped to a
// real address. As far as we know this is the first API where that is the whole
// transaction: no account, no card, no human in the loop on the buying side.
// The agent quotes the job for free at POST /api/print/quote, gets back an
// HMAC-signed quote token, and settles that token's exact total here in USDC on
// Solana.
//
// The order of operations is the product:
//
//   1. the quote token is verified and the shipping address validated BEFORE
//      any 402 is issued, so a malformed order is refused for free (422) and a
//      caller never pays for something that was going to be rejected;
//   2. the 402 quotes the token's own total, not a list price. Every order is
//      its own amount, because a print is its own object;
//   3. the handler opens the order and moves it to `quoted`;
//   4. settlement happens in the wrapper, and only once it succeeds does the
//      post-settlement hook move the order paid -> screening. An order that
//      never settled therefore never reaches the production floor.
//
// A probe with no body (x402 catalogs do this constantly) gets a well-formed
// challenge at the catalog's floor price with a description that says where the
// real price comes from. Nothing can settle against it: a paid retry still has
// to carry a token this server signed.
//
// The buyer keeps a receipt they can read without an account: the response
// carries the order id, and GET /api/print/orders/:id serves its timeline.

	'shipped to a street address, paying in USDC. Quote first at ' +
	'POST /api/print/quote (free, keyless) with a creationId or a glbUrl, a ' +
	'materialId from GET /api/print/catalog, a target height in millimetres and ' +

	'and a signed quote token. Post the token plus a shipping address here and ' +
	'the 402 challenge quotes that quote\'s exact total. Settling it opens a real ' +
