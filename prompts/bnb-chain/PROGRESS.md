# BNB Chain Campaign — Progress Log

Append-only. Each completing agent adds a dated entry: prompt #, what shipped, real proof
(tx hashes, block numbers, JSON responses), gaps noticed for other prompts.

---

## 2026-07-07 — Campaign created

Research basis: 101-agent deep-research run + bnb-chain org repo dig (verified facts and
refuted claims recorded in `00-CONTEXT.md`). Owner approved all three tracks. No prompt
executed yet.

---

## 2026-07-08 — Prompt 01: BNB chain constants + RPC failover lib — SHIPPED, verified live

**Outcome: `api/_lib/bnb/chains.js` done and proven.** Built by a concurrent agent sharing
this worktree; independently re-verified line-by-line against `00-CONTEXT.md` and the spec
rather than trusted as-is (untracked, not yet committed).

- `BNB_CHAINS.bscMainnet.greenfieldHubs` — all six hub addresses (crossChain, tokenHub,
  bucketHub, objectHub, groupHub, multiMessage) match `00-CONTEXT.md` verbatim.
  `bscMainnet.id=56` (5 public RPCs), `bscTestnet.id=97` (4 public RPCs, default network).
- `getPublicClient(network, opts)` — viem `fallback()` transport (deterministic order,
  `rank:false`), 5s per-RPC timeout, cached per network. Accepts numeric ids and string
  aliases (`'bsc'`/`'mainnet'`/`'testnet'`) beyond the spec's literal names — ergonomic
  superset, not a deviation.
- `probeBlockTime(network, sampleBlocks=200)` — `{network, avgBlockTimeMs, latestBlock,
  sampleBlocks, target, measuredAt}`; throws typed `BnbRpcError{tried:[...]}` on total
  failure. `isEvmAddress`/`assertBscAddress` reuse viem's `isAddress`/`getAddress`.
- **Tests:** `tests/bnb-chains.test.js` — 12 passed + 1 skipped (BNB_LIVE_RPC-gated) by
  default; with `BNB_LIVE_RPC=1` → **13/13 passed**, live smoke test asserted
  `avgBlockTimeMs < 700ms` for real.

**Live proof the 0.45s block-time claim holds today** (real public RPC, not mocked):
```json
{ "network": "bscMainnet", "avgBlockTimeMs": 450, "latestBlock": 108693266,
  "sampleBlocks": 200, "target": 450, "measuredAt": "2026-07-08T00:39:03.963Z" }
```

**Status: DONE.** Every other BNB prompt can now import this lib. Not yet committed —
still untracked in the shared worktree pending an explicit commit pass.

## 2026-07-08 — Prompt 08: Encrypted-GLB envelope + vault manifest spec — SHIPPED

**Outcome: `api/_lib/bnb/vault-crypto.js` + `specs/vault-manifest.md` done and proven.**
Standalone (Prereqs: none), no file overlap with prompts 01/02.

- `encryptGlb`/`decryptGlb` — AES-256-GCM via Node's built-in `crypto` (OpenSSL-backed),
  random 32-byte content key + 12-byte IV per object, 16-byte GCM auth tag, plaintext
  sha256 computed and verifiable via `decryptGlb(env, {expectedSha256})`.
- `wrapKey`/`unwrapKey` — ECIES over secp256k1 (ephemeral ECDH → HKDF-SHA256 → AES-256-GCM),
  built directly on `@noble/curves` + `@noble/hashes` — **already-installed, already-pinned
  workspace dependencies** (`package.json`: `@noble/curves ^2.2.0`, `@noble/hashes ^1.8.0`).
  Deliberately did **not** add `eciesjs`: it depends on the same two `@noble/*` packages
  internally (confirmed via `npm view eciesjs` — `@noble/curves ^1.9.7`, `@noble/hashes
  ^1.8.0`), and its curves major (1.x) conflicts with our installed 2.x, so adding it would
  install a second, older copy of the exact library already in the tree — the opposite of
  CLAUDE.md's "check existing workspace dependencies first / never add a duplicate" rule.
  `package.json` is also mid-edit by other concurrent agents right now (`git status` showed
  it modified before I started), so avoiding any `npm install` sidesteps that shared-file
  hazard entirely. No hand-rolled crypto primitives — only the standard ECIES
  *composition* (ECDH + HKDF + AEAD) is original code, same construction `eciesjs`/
  `eth-crypto` use.
- Typed `VaultCryptoError{code}` for every failure path (`bad_input`, `bad_length`,
  `bad_public_key`, `bad_ecdh_input`, `auth_failed`, `sha256_mismatch`) — tampered
  ciphertext/tag or wrong unwrap key always throws, never returns garbage plaintext.
- `specs/vault-manifest.md` — full wire contract: manifest JSON schema
  (`version/glbObjectRef/encryption/sha256/priceAtomic/sellerAddress/contract/createdAt`),
  byte layout (ciphertext stored as a header-free blob, manifest as a sibling JSON file),
  key-delivery flow (seller encrypts+uploads → buyer pays on-chain (prompt 10) → unlock
  service (prompt 11) wraps the content key to the buyer's pubkey → buyer unwraps+decrypts),
  typed error → HTTP status mapping, and a portability note confirming nothing here imports
  a Greenfield SDK or assumes its async settlement model (hedges the platform-risk in
  00-CONTEXT).
- **Tests:** `tests/bnb-vault-crypto.test.js` — 14/14 passed. Round trip against a tiny but
  structurally valid synthetic GLB fixture (real glTF binary magic + minimal JSON chunk,
  built inline in the test, no external fixture file needed). Covers: byte-identical
  round trip + sha256 match, empty-input rejection, ciphertext-byte tamper → typed
  `auth_failed`, auth-tag tamper → typed error, wrong-size key/IV rejected pre-cipher,
  `expectedSha256` mismatch caught post-GCM-success, ECIES round trip with a real
  secp256k1 keypair, uncompressed (65-byte) pubkey accepted, wrap non-determinism
  (different ephemeral key/ciphertext every call), wrong-private-key unwrap → typed
  `auth_failed`, malformed pubkey rejected, and a full encrypt→wrap→hex-wire→unwrap→decrypt
  pipeline simulation.

  Command: `npx vitest run tests/bnb-vault-crypto.test.js` → `Test Files 1 passed (1)`,
  `Tests 14 passed (14)`.

**Real round-trip proof** (88-byte synthetic GLB — glTF binary header + minimal JSON chunk):
- Plaintext sha256: `3973610786a91c775bae59677a8020251bd31bebd284fa897ca97a8a24e20e71`
- `encryptGlb` → `contentKey` (32B), `iv` (12B), `authTag` (16B), 88-byte ciphertext;
  `sha256OfPlaintext` matches the value above exactly.
- Fresh secp256k1 buyer keypair generated via `generateVaultKeypair()`.
- `wrapKey(contentKey, buyer.publicKey)` → 33-byte compressed `ephemeralPublicKey` +
  wrapped-key ciphertext/iv/authTag.
- `unwrapKey(wrapped, buyer.privateKey)` → recovered content key byte-equal to the
  original (`true`).
- `decryptGlb({...}, {expectedSha256})` → plaintext byte-equal to the original 88-byte
  GLB (`true`); post-decrypt sha256 re-check passes (`true`).

**Status: DONE.** No blockers. `specs/vault-manifest.md` is ready for prompts 09
(upload), 10 (contract), and 11 (unlock) to build against as-is.

---

## 2026-07-08 — Prompt 02: MegaFuel gasless-send client — SHIPPED, committed `c61c96452`

**Outcome: `api/_lib/bnb/megafuel.js` + `tests/bnb-megafuel.test.js` done and proven.**
Prereq `api/_lib/bnb/chains.js` (prompt 01) confirmed committed at `92bab1faf` before this
prompt started — the "not yet committed" note in the prompt-01 entry above is stale. A
concurrent agent had already built both megafuel files UNTRACKED in this worktree —
reviewed line-by-line against `02-megafuel-client.md` rather than trusted as-is, and it was
mostly correct: `isSponsorable`/`sendGasless` contracts, mandatory self-pay fallback
(decline / MegaFuel error / failed sponsored submit all resolve to self-pay), the
no-private-key-in-module invariant, and `.env.example`'s `NODEREAL_MEGAFUEL_KEY=` entry all
matched spec as-built.

**One real bug found and fixed:** `megafuelEndpoint()` appended `NODEREAL_MEGAFUEL_KEY` as
a URL path segment onto `bsc-megafuel(-testnet).nodereal.io` when the key was set — this
does not match NodeReal's actual API. Cross-checked live against
`docs.nodereal.io/reference/pm-issponsorable`, `.../eth-sendrawtransaction-megafuel`, and
`.../pm-createpolicy`: `pm_isSponsorable` / `eth_sendRawTransaction` run **unauthenticated**
at the plain base URL always; the `{apikey}` path segment only exists on the *separate*
policy-management gateway (`open-platform-ap.nodereal.io/{apikey}/megafuel(-testnet)`,
`pm_createPolicy`/`pm_updatePolicy` — a one-time sponsor setup step, out of this prompt's
scope). Sponsorship is resolved server-side purely by matching the tx's `from` address
against an already-provisioned policy. Fixed `megafuelEndpoint()` to always return the base
URL, rewrote the `.env.example` comment to explain the key's real scope, and updated the
test that had asserted the old (wrong) key-appending behavior.

- **Tests:** `tests/bnb-megafuel.test.js` — **13/13 passed**, all with injected mocks
  (`megafuelRpc`/`publicClient`/`walletClient`) plus a synthetic per-run throwaway account
  (`generatePrivateKey()`), never a real key. Covers: `isSponsorable` true/false/error-as-
  decline; `sendGasless` sponsored path; self-pay fallback on decline, on MegaFuel throwing,
  and on a sponsored-send failure after an accepted probe; self-pay-also-fails → typed
  `MegaFuelError`; malformed `tx.to` / bad signer rejected before any network call; source
  grep asserting no private-key/mnemonic/raw-key literal in the module.

**Live proof #1 — real `pm_isSponsorable` probe against the public BSC testnet MegaFuel
endpoint** (raw JSON reply, unmocked, `to`/`from` = burn address so a decline is expected
and is itself valid proof the wire format is accepted):
```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"result":{"sponsorable":false}}
```
Through our own `isSponsorable()`: `{"sponsorable":false,"sponsorInfo":null,"reason":"not sponsorable"}`.

**Live proof #2 — full `sendGasless()` self-pay path, real EVM execution.** No NodeReal
sponsor policy exists for our sender (or any unregistered sender — proof #1 shows that), so
a real *sponsored* send isn't obtainable without the owner provisioning a policy at
dashboard.nodereal.io. Per 00-CONTEXT's decision-default table ("If every faucet fails:
finish ALL code + tests against a local `anvil --chain-id 97` fork") — the public BSC
testnet faucet (`bnbchain.org/en/testnet-faucet`) requires an interactive reCAPTCHA with no
programmatic path, so a real broadcast tx hash on the public testnet wasn't obtainable
either. Installed Foundry (`foundryup`, not previously present in this environment), forked
live BSC testnet state with `anvil --chain-id 97 --fork-url <public testnet RPC>`, funded a
synthetic throwaway account (`0x6b4fFe6F3381Af8fdA5e5c0fe35Df6C261789820`, generated
on-the-spot, private key discarded after the run) via `anvil_setBalance`, then ran the real
`sendGasless()` export (not a reimplementation) against that fork — real probe to the live
MegaFuel testnet endpoint + a real self-pay send through viem's `walletClient` against
forked BSC-testnet EVM state:
```json
{"hash":"0xd5ca4bce0f7ecd78f3f8afe5bb3553f3599c4c359d7cfbe98af6eebe42f2e905","mode":"self-pay","reason":"not sponsorable"}
```
Receipt: `status: success, gasUsed: 21000, effectiveGasPrice: 1000000000` (1 gwei — a real
gas charge, proving this is genuinely the self-pay path, not sponsored). Sender balance
went from 1.0 → 0.998979 tBNB, exactly 21000 gas × 1 gwei + the 0.001 tBNB transfer value.

**Gap for the owner / prompt 03+:** a real sponsored (`mode:'sponsored'`, `gasPrice 0`,
on-chain) send cannot be proven until a NodeReal MegaFuel sponsor policy is created for our
sender/contract at dashboard.nodereal.io (needs `NODEREAL_MEGAFUEL_KEY` + `pm_createPolicy`
against `open-platform-ap.nodereal.io/{key}/megafuel-testnet` — not implemented in this
module by design, out of scope per the spec). Until then every real send transparently
self-pays, which is the mandated behavior, not a broken state. A funded
`BNB_TESTNET_DEPLOYER_KEY` for a **real broadcast** (vs. the anvil-fork proof above) is
still needed for prompt 03 (registration) and 15 (world-moves) to post an actual public
BscScan-visible tx; the faucet's reCAPTCHA remains the blocker — same gap prompt 01 will
hit if it wants a real broadcast rather than a read-only RPC probe.

**Status: DONE.** `isSponsorable`/`sendGasless` are ready for prompt 03/15 to import.

## 2026-07-08 — Prompt 20: BABT verification spike — VERDICT: REAL, SHIPPED

**Truth-before-code gate: PASSED.** BABT (Binance Account Bound Token) is real, live on
BSC mainnet AND testnet, and third-party-queryable today via a single free `eth_call`.
Full research writeup with sources: `docs/bnb-babt-findings.md`.

**Contract identity — real `eth_getCode` + `name()` probes, not taken on faith:**
- Mainnet `0x2B09d47D550061f995A3b5C6F0Fd58005215D7c8` — bytecode present (3622 bytes),
  `name()` = `"Binance Account Bound Token"`, `totalSupply()` = 1,164,243 (matches
  BscScan's 1.16M+ holder count). Verified contract, 1.4M+ transactions.
- Testnet `0x984E6a7b9cb73cB7884c9ca9b1Ee625546F9D0E3` — also has real bytecode,
  `name()` = same string, `totalSupply()` = 1,252. **A real testnet deployment exists**
  (contrary to 00-CONTEXT's working assumption) — real mints, but developer test
  accounts, not KYC'd Binance users, so it's useful for integration testing only.
- Both addresses sourced from Binance's own docs (`developers.binance.com/docs/babt/apis-spec`),
  never invented.

**Real holder proof — found by scanning live `Transfer` (mint) logs on the mainnet
contract, then reading the resulting address back through the real interface:**
```
mint found in blocks 108689374–108694374 → holder 0x04d1c36842430a169d132ada68006e6bb9e3808b
balanceOf(holder) = 1
tokenIdOf(holder) = 1316815
balanceOf(0x…dEaD burn address) = 0   (sanity check)
```
Interface: BEP-721-extending soulbound token — `balanceOf(address)`, `tokenIdOf(address)`,
`ownerOf(uint256)`, `totalSupply()`, all free public `view` reads, no API key/Binance
relationship needed to *read*. Non-transferable; Binance can revoke + re-mint to a new
wallet (rotates `tokenId` — don't treat it as a stable identity anchor, per Binance's own
integration warning).

**Shipped** (gate passed → build half executed):
- `api/_lib/bnb/babt.js` — `hasBabt(address, network?, opts?)`, mainnet-default,
  typed `BabtCheckError` on a real read failure, tokenIdOf failure never downgrades a
  confirmed `balanceOf>0` holder to a false negative.
- `GET /api/bnb/babt-check?address=&network=` — free, rate-limited (`limits.publicIp`),
  400 on bad input/unknown network, 502 `contract_unreachable` on RPC failure, honest
  `note` field distinguishing the real mainnet KYC signal from the testnet
  developer-only caveat.
- `tests/bnb-babt.test.js` (10 tests, +1 live-RPC-gated) — lib-level, mocked client for
  determinism, live test re-proving the exact holder above against the real contract
  (`BNB_LIVE_RPC=1` → 10/10 passed, confirms `holdsBabt:true`, `tokenId` populated).
- `tests/bnb-babt-check-endpoint.test.js` (13 tests) — endpoint validation, success,
  upstream-failure, and rate-limit paths, mocked `hasBabt`/`limits` (kept in its own
  file — `vi.mock` hoisting would otherwise shadow the real `hasBabt` the lib suite
  exercises directly).
- `docs/bnb-babt-findings.md` — full verdict, live probe output, interface, limitations
  (KYC-not-permanent-identity, mainnet-primary, single-issuer trust), and an honest
  comparison vs. Gitcoin Passport / World ID / Coinbase attestations.
- `00-CONTEXT.md` refuted-list line updated to reflect the settled verdict.

**Gap for future prompts:** no gap — the read path needs nothing further (no key, no
funded wallet, no policy). If a future prompt wants to *gate* a three.ws feature (mint,
allowlist, etc.) on `hasBabt`, `api/_lib/bnb/babt.js` is ready to import directly.

**Status: DONE.** Open question closed; `hasBabt`/`/api/bnb/babt-check` ready to import.

## 2026-07-08 — Prompts 04 + 05 + 06: MPP payments (accept + pay + docs) — SHIPPED

**Outcome: three.ws is x402↔MPP bilingual.** `@bnb-chain/mpp`'s b402 layer is x402 v2
(same `X-PAYMENT`/`X-PAYMENT-RESPONSE` headers + EIP-3009 credential our Base path already
signs), so "speaking MPP" = advertising a BNB-network (`eip155:56`/`97`) accept entry and
routing BNB-network payments through the b402 facilitator, leaving the Solana/Base x402 path
untouched. `@bnb-chain/mpp@0.2.0` was already in `node_modules`; used its `/b402` primitives
rather than hand-rolling the wire format.

- **04 — server (`api/_lib/bnb/mpp-server.js`):** `mppRequirements`/`mppChallenge` emit a
  spec-shaped BNB 402 (extra fields preferred from a live `/supported` kind); `mppVerify`
  decodes → full-shape-gates (`isEip3009PaymentPayload`) → pins every buyer-echoed field to
  ours (network/asset/payTo/amount/scheme) → `recoverEip3009Payer` (must equal
  `authorization.from`) → Redis `SET NX PX` replay guard (process-local fallback);
  `mppSettle` calls the b402 facilitator `/settle`. Split verify/settle so the endpoint runs
  verify (free) → work → settle, never charging on a data-outage 503. Wired ADDITIVELY into
  the `three-intel` pilot: `looksLikeMppPayment(req)` routes BNB payments to b402; every
  Solana/Base/unpaid request falls through to the untouched `paidEndpoint` x402 handler.
- **05 — buyer (`api/_lib/bnb/mpp-buyer.js`):** `mppFetch(url, opts, { account, maxSpend })`
  runs the 402→sign(EIP-3009)→retry loop with a HARD pre-signature spend cap (over-quote →
  `over_budget`, ZERO payment sent), bounded retries (no infinite loop), synthetic-account
  tested. Re-exported from `api/_lib/x402-buyer-fetch.js` so agents that already import the
  x402 buyer get MPP from the same surface.
- **06 — docs:** `docs/bnb-payments.md` (linked from start-here) + `specs/x402-mpp-bridge.md`
  (the credential-mapping / header-precedence / replay contract). Every code sample runnable.

**Tests (all green):** `tests/bnb-mpp-server.test.js` (15 — REAL signatures via
`buildEip3009Payment`, so `recoverEip3009Payer` runs the true path; replay + pin + settle),
`tests/bnb-mpp-buyer.test.js` (9 — happy path, cap enforcement with call-count assertion,
unsupported/missing credential, bounded retry). Existing `tests/api/three-intel.test.js`
still 11/11 — additive wiring did not touch the x402 path. Full BNB suite 110 passed.

**Proof — real EIP-3009 credential round-trip (unit, no faucet needed):** a synthetic account
signs a real `TransferWithAuthorization`; `mppVerify` recovers the exact signer and pins the
offer; a second presentation of the same nonce → `replay` (HTTP 409). `mppSettle` with an
injected facilitator client returns a b402 `X-PAYMENT-RESPONSE`.

**Gap for the owner:** real on-chain settlement needs b402 MERCHANT CREDENTIALS
(`B402_BASE_URL`/`B402_CLIENT_ID`/`B402_ACCESS_TOKEN`/`B402_PRIVATE_KEY`, RSA "Tesla"
signing — provision at the Binance OnchainPay merchant console). Without them the adapter
verifies off-chain and returns `mpp_not_configured` (503) for settle — never a fabricated
receipt. `X402_PAY_TO_BSC` must also be set to advertise MPP. All code + tests are complete;
this is a credential-provisioning step, not a code gap.

**Status: DONE (code + tests + docs).** Blocked only on external b402 merchant onboarding.

## 2026-07-08 — Prompt 19: `/bnb` hub page — SHIPPED

**Outcome: the campaign's front door is live.** Built as prompt 01 said to run it — early,
with honest coming-soon states — since only prompt 01 was confirmed shipped when this prompt
started (prompts 02/04/05/06/08/20 above landed concurrently mid-build; the auto-light-up
logic below picked several of them up for free by the time I finished — see proof).

- `pages/bnb.html` + `src/bnb.js` (`→ /bnb`) — hero, a live block-time proof strip, and three
  feature cards (gasless onboarding, on-chain-gated vault, real-time on-chain world). Every
  claim traces to 00-CONTEXT's verified list; explicitly never claims 20k TPS or 250ms
  finality (BEP-670 called out as not-live). CLAUDE.md UI bar: skeleton/loading, retry-able
  error, responsive at 320/768/1440, `prefers-reduced-motion` respected, hover/active/focus
  states on every interactive element, `aria-live` status regions.
- `api/bnb/block-time.js` — free GET endpoint wrapping prompt 01's `probeBlockTime`
  (bscMainnet default, 10s cache, rate-limited via `limits.publicIp`). No hardcoded "0.45s" —
  measured fresh on every cache miss.
- `src/bnb-hub-helpers.js` — pure formatters (`formatBlockTime`, `formatBlockNumber`,
  `deltaFromTarget`) + track-liveness gating (`trackLiveness`, `combineTrackStates`), unit
  tested in `tests/bnb-hub-helpers.test.js` (17/17 passed, no mocks needed — pure functions).
- **Auto-light-up mechanism (real checks, not flags):** each card issues a `HEAD` probe (4s
  timeout) against its track's canonical route/API on the running deployment. `404` or a
  network error → "coming soon" (fails closed); any other status (including `405` from a
  POST-only endpoint probed with `HEAD`) → "live". Card targets: gasless →
  `/api/bnb/register-agent` (prompt 03, not yet shipped) with a secondary docs link gated on
  `/docs/bnb-payments.md` (prompt 06 — **shipped concurrently, so this secondary link is now
  live**); vault → `/vault` (prompt 12, not yet shipped); on-chain world → `/bnb-latency`
  (prompt 17, not yet shipped).
- Docs/wiring: `data/pages.json` (`/bnb` registered), `STRUCTURE.md` row, `data/changelog.json`
  (tag `feature`), `public/nav-data.js` (Discover → Start here, next to Labs), Vite build
  input + dev-server rewrite, `vercel.json` clean-URL route (`/bnb/?` → `/bnb.html`).

**Live proof — block-time widget, real RPC, unmocked** (invoked the actual exported handler
with mock req/res, not a reimplementation):
```json
{"network":"bscMainnet","avgBlockTimeMs":450,"latestBlock":108695844,"sampleBlocks":200,"target":450,"measuredAt":"2026-07-08T00:58:24.182Z"}
```
Response headers confirmed: `200`, `cache-control: public, max-age=5, s-maxage=10,
stale-while-revalidate=30`, CORS `*`. A second direct `probeBlockTime` call moments later
returned `latestBlock: 108695821` — block number advancing in real time across separate
processes, i.e. genuinely live chain state, not a cached fixture.

**Manual verification:** `npm run dev`, `curl` against the Vite dev server — `/bnb` returns
200 and contains `#bnb-grid`/`#bnb-proof-card`/the `src/bnb.js` module tag; `HEAD /vault`,
`HEAD /bnb-latency`, `HEAD /api/bnb/register-agent` all correctly 404 (not yet built, so the
gating renders coming-soon); `HEAD /docs/bnb-payments.md` correctly 200 (prompt 06 landed
concurrently). `npm run build:pages` validated `data/pages.json`/`data/changelog.json`
cleanly (`2/7 files updated`, no errors). Did not drive a real Chromium session (none
available in this environment) — verification is curl + direct-handler-invocation against
real RPC/HTTP, not a headless-browser screenshot; no console-error check was possible for
that reason. `npx vitest run tests/bnb-hub-helpers.test.js` → 17/17 passed.

**Shared-worktree note:** every file this prompt touched was independently confirmed
committed with byte-identical content to what was authored here — but bundled into three
*other* agents' commits (`7e185b58d`, `cf190dfd3`, `f6dbb8ac3`) via their own broad `git add`
sweeps, not a commit run by this prompt. Flagging per the "known traps" section rather than
rewriting history: content is safe and correct, only the commit *messages* don't mention this
work.

**Gap for prompts 03/06(UI)/12/16/17:** none from this side — the hub's gating logic needs no
changes as those tracks ship; a `HEAD` 200/405 on the routes named above is the entire
contract. Prompt 03 should note that the gasless-registration card's primary CTA points to
`/create-agent` (existing ERC-8004 identity surface) — wire the "Register on BNB (gasless)"
affordance there, not a new route, or update `TRACKS[0].primary.href` in `src/bnb.js` if it
lands somewhere else.

**Status: DONE.**

## 2026-07-08 — Prompt 07: Greenfield read client — SHIPPED, verified live

**Outcome: `api/_lib/bnb/greenfield.js` + `tests/bnb-greenfield-read.test.js` done.** The
read layer Track B's vault (upload 09, unlock 11) composes: bucket/object metadata,
permission derivation, SP byte download, all read-only against Greenfield testnet.

**Open-source decision:** `@bnb-chain/greenfield-js-sdk` (2.2.2) is a heavy
protobuf/tendermint/cosmos dependency tree; every read we need is a plain HTTPS call. Per
00-CONTEXT's "wrap the minimal REST yourself" default (same bundle-lean rationale as
`erc8004-chains.js`), the module calls the live endpoints directly with `fetch` rather than
bloating the serverless bundle: chain metadata via the Greenfield grpc-gateway REST
(`/greenfield/storage/head_bucket/{b}`, `/head_object/{b}/{o}`), object bytes via the SP
S3-style virtual-hosted gateway.

- **Exports:** `headBucket`, `getObjectMeta`, `getObjectPermissions`, `listObjects`,
  `downloadObject`, `greenfieldNetwork`, `GreenfieldError`, `VISIBILITY`.
- **Permissions:** the public REST gateway does NOT expose `verify_permission`
  (returns grpc code 12 "Not Implemented", confirmed live), so `getObjectPermissions`
  derives read access from on-chain ObjectInfo (`PUBLIC_READ` → anyone; else owner-only) and
  documents that fine-grained policy/group grants resolve via a `downloadObject` auth-probe.
- **States:** not_found (chain codes 1100/1101), forbidden (SP 403 — the vault's LOCKED
  signal, typed not thrown-500), unavailable (SP 5xx → SP failover → typed 503), bad_request
  (malformed name, rejected before any network call), pending (async mirror lag surfaced).

**Tests:** `tests/bnb-greenfield-read.test.js` — **17/17 passed**, all with an injected
`fetchImpl` (offline, deterministic), synthetic bucket/object names only. Covers meta shape,
not_found mapping, owner/public/denied permission derivation, download bytes + forbidden +
not_found + SP-failover + all-SPs-down, and XML/JSON list parsing.

**Live proof (real Greenfield testnet grpc-gateway, through the module):**
- `headBucket('three-ws-synthetic-probe-bucket')` → `GreenfieldError not_found` "codespace
  storage code 1100: No such bucket" — real chain response.
- `getObjectMeta(..., 'model.glb')` → `GreenfieldError not_found` "codespace storage code
  1101: No such object" — real chain response.
  These prove the read wire is live end-to-end. Reading a SPECIFIC public object's metadata /
  proving the forbidden download on a real private object both need an object to exist first,
  which is prompt 09's funded upload (same tBNB-faucet blocker noted in prompts 01/02).

**Status: DONE (code + tests, live-wire proven).** Upload (09) + unlock (11) can import it.

## 2026-07-08 — Prompt 10: GreenfieldVault.sol (pay → PermissionHub grant) — SHIPPED, deploy BLOCKED

**Outcome: `contracts/src/GreenfieldVault.sol` + real interface stubs + full Foundry
test suite done and compiling/passing. Live BSC testnet deploy is blocked on a funded
deployer key (same as items 13/18) — everything else is deploy-ready.**

- **Real interfaces, not invented ones.** `contracts/src/greenfield/{IPermissionHub,
  ICrossChain,IGnfdAccessControl,IApplication}.sol` reproduce the exact ABIs from
  `bnb-chain/greenfield-contracts` (`contracts/interface/*.sol` +
  `middle-layer/resource-mirror/storage/{PermissionStorage,CmnStorage}.sol` +
  `storage/PackageQueue.sol`), fetched and verified against `master` on 2026-07-08 —
  every function signature, the `ExtraData`/`FailureHandleStrategy` types, and every
  address are sourced, not guessed. Kept as minimal self-contained interfaces (not the
  full upgradeable implementation tree) so this workspace doesn't need to add
  `@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable` as a new dependency.
- **Real addresses, cross-checked two ways.** Mainnet CrossChain/ObjectHub from
  `00-CONTEXT.md`'s bytecode-verified list; PermissionHub mainnet + all four testnet
  hub addresses read live from `bnb-chain/greenfield-contracts`' README "Contract
  Entrypoint" tables (testnet PermissionHub `0x25E1eeDb5CaBf288210B132321FBB2d90b4174ad`,
  CrossChain `0xa5B2c9194131A4E0BFaCbF9E5D6722c873159cb7`, ObjectHub
  `0x1b059D8481dEe299713F18601fB539D066553e39`) — full table in `DEPLOYMENTS.md`.
- **`list`/`buy`/`revoke` exactly as specced, plus what "the vault must control its
  permissions" actually means on-chain:** `list()` requires the seller to have already
  called the real `IGnfdAccessControl.grantRole(ROLE_CREATE, vaultAddress, expiry)` on
  ObjectHub — checked live via `hasRole`, not merely asserted. `buy()` takes an
  off-chain-built GNFD permission payload (`policyData`, opaque bytes — no EVM contract
  encodes GNFD protobuf on-chain, real PermissionHub doesn't either), validates
  `price + live crossChain.getRelayFees()` atomically (no half-execution on
  underpayment or an uncovered relay fee), forwards the real relay fee to
  `PermissionHub.createPolicy`, and emits `Purchased`. Because `createPolicy` is
  genuinely asynchronous (00-CONTEXT: "poll for effect, never assume same-block"), the
  vault implements `IApplication.greenfieldCall` to receive the real minted policy id
  when Greenfield's ack settles, emitting `PolicyGranted`/`PolicyGrantFailed` — the
  "surface pending honestly" pattern the rest of this campaign uses, not a fabricated
  synchronous policyId. `revoke()` is seller-gated, calls the real
  `PermissionHub.deletePolicy`, documented as permanent-grants-by-default with an
  explicit escape hatch (spec left this a documented choice). Multiple buyers can each
  hold an independent grant on the same object (content-access marketplace, not
  ownership transfer); double-buy by the same buyer is idempotent-by-design
  (`AlreadyPurchased`, cleared on revoke/failed-settlement so a retry/resell works).
  Pull-payment `withdraw()` for seller proceeds; `nonReentrant` on every state-changing
  external-payment path.
- **Tests:** `contracts/test/GreenfieldVault.t.sol` (34 tests) +
  `contracts/test/mocks/{MockGreenfield.sol,Reentrant.sol}` — mocked
  PermissionHub/CrossChain/IGnfdAccessControl faithful to the real two-phase syn/ack
  flow (a `settleCreatePolicy(policyId, status)` harness call plays the Greenfield
  relayer). Covers: list requires role grant, only-seller list/delist, relist repricing,
  listed-by-another-seller, buy happy path + settlement, unlisted/empty-data/underpayment/
  missing-relay-fee reverts (atomic, no partial state), excess-payment refund, double-buy
  reverts and clears on failed-settlement/revoke, `greenfieldCall` access control (only
  PermissionHub, only the real channel id, unknown-sale guard), full revoke lifecycle
  (only sale's seller, requires `Granted` status, insufficient-fee revert, excess-fee
  refund), withdraw pull-payment, `quoteRelayFee` view, and two dedicated
  cross-function re-entrancy proofs (a `buy()` refund trying to re-enter `buy()` on a
  separate valid listing; a `withdraw()` payout trying to re-enter `withdraw()`) —
  both assert the nested low-level call fails with OpenZeppelin's
  `ReentrancyGuardReentrantCall` specifically, not just "nothing happened to steal".
- **`contracts/script/DeployGreenfieldVault.s.sol`** — selects real hub addresses by
  `block.chainid` (56/97), env-overridable. Dry-run proof below.

**Real build/test proof:**
```
$ forge build
Compiler run successful!

$ forge test --match-path test/GreenfieldVault.t.sol
Ran 34 tests for test/GreenfieldVault.t.sol:GreenfieldVaultTest
Suite result: ok. 34 passed; 0 failed; 0 skipped

$ forge test   # full contracts/ workspace, nothing else touched
Ran 6 test suites: 94 tests passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped
```

**Deploy: BLOCKED on a funded deployer key (owner-only, same as items 13/18).**
`forge script script/DeployGreenfieldVault.s.sol:DeployGreenfieldVault --rpc-url
https://data-seed-prebsc-1-s1.bnbchain.org:8545 -vvvv` (no `--broadcast`) simulated
successfully end-to-end against the LIVE BSC testnet RPC: constructor executes with the
real testnet PermissionHub/CrossChain/ObjectHub addresses baked in, ~1.16M gas estimated
at 0.1 gwei ≈ 0.000170 BNB. Checked (presence only, no secret values read):
`DEPLOYER_PK`/`BNB_TESTNET_DEPLOYER_KEY` absent from shell env, no root `.env`, no
`contracts/.env`, `cast wallet list` empty. Full dry-run trace + constructor args
recorded in `DEPLOYMENTS.md`'s new GreenfieldVault section.

**Other changes:** added `BSC_TESTNET_RPC_URL`/`BSCSCAN_API_KEY` to
`contracts/.env.example` and `bsc_testnet`/`bsc` entries to `contracts/foundry.toml`
`[rpc_endpoints]`/`[etherscan]` (additive only — did not touch `AgentPayments.sol`,
the ERC-8004 registries, or `api/_lib/bnb/`, per this prompt's file boundaries).

**Gap for prompt 11 (unlock API) / 13 (e2e proof):** the real end-to-end proof (a real
`buy()` tx, a real `createPolicy` ack settling, a real `PolicyGranted` with a real
Greenfield policy id, cross-checked on GreenfieldScan) needs both this contract deployed
AND a real uploaded+listed object (prompt 09, same funding blocker) — same single root
cause blocking 07/08/09/13/14/18 in this campaign.

**Status: DONE (code + tests). Deploy BLOCKED on funded deployer key — owner action
needed.**

## 2026-07-08 — Prompt 03: Gas-free ERC-8004 agent registration on BSC — SHIPPED, verified live end-to-end with real mints

**Outcome: `api/_lib/bnb/erc8004-gasless.js`, `api/bnb/register-agent.js`,
`src/erc8004/gasless-register.js`, and the `/deploy` wizard's new gasless panel are done
and proven with REAL BSC testnet mints — not simulations.** Prereqs 01/02 confirmed
committed (`92bab1faf`, `c61c96452`) and imported as-is; `megafuel.js` gained one small
additive export (`submitRawTx`, a low-level "relay bytes I was handed" primitive — see
below for why `sendGasless()` didn't fit this prompt's signing model).

**Architecture decision — why this ISN'T `sendGasless()`:** the spec's phrasing ("server
relays via `sendGasless`") assumes a server-held signer. That's right for prompt 02's
demo/ops account, but wrong here: this endpoint must never see a private key. Real
design: the CLIENT (browser wallet or, for the true "zero-balance wallet" demo, an
in-page ephemeral viem account whose key lives in `sessionStorage` only) signs a
*legacy* `register(agentURI)` transaction entirely itself — with `gasPrice: 0` for a
gasless attempt, or a real `gasPrice` for a self-pay attempt — and POSTs only the raw
signed bytes. The server (`relayGaslessRegistration`) parses them (`viem.parseTransaction`
+ `recoverTransactionAddress`), validates the target is the real Identity Registry, and
either relays the EXACT bytes to MegaFuel's `eth_sendRawTransaction` (gasless branch) or
broadcasts them as-is via the public RPC (self-pay branch) — it never constructs or signs
anything. A `gasPrice: 0` tx that MegaFuel declines is mechanically unbroadcastable on any
normal node (guaranteed underpriced-tx rejection outside the paymaster path), so a decline
returns `{ mode: 'declined', reason, hint }` instead of attempting a doomed send — the
caller re-signs with a real gasPrice and POSTs again to self-pay.

**Two real bugs found and fixed by live testing (would have shipped broken from mocks alone):**
1. **Already-registered guard crashed on the real contract.** The live BSC Testnet
   Identity Registry (`0x8004A818BFB912233c491871b3d84c89A494BD9e`) declares
   `tokenOfOwnerByIndex` in its ABI but **reverts** on every call to it (no
   ERC721Enumerable storage wired) — confirmed live 2026-07-08. The original guard did
   `.catch(() => null)` around the whole already-registered check, which silently treated
   a revert as "not registered" and would have let an already-registered address slip
   into a duplicate mint attempt. Fixed: `balanceOf` alone (which works) now
   short-circuits registration; `tokenOfOwnerByIndex` is best-effort enrichment only —
   `agentId: null` with `alreadyRegistered: true` when it can't be resolved, never a
   silent false negative.
2. **agentId decoded from the wrong topic when both `Transfer` and `Registered` logs are
   present.** Every real mint emits BOTH events in the same receipt, with `Transfer`
   logged first. `Transfer(from, to, tokenId)` puts `tokenId` at `topics[3]`, not
   `topics[1]` (that's `from`, which is `0x0` on a mint) — a naive "first
   Registered-or-Transfer match, read `topics[1]`" decoder silently returned `"0"` as the
   agentId on every real registration. Live testing caught it immediately (a real mint
   returning agentId `"0"` was an obvious tell). Fixed: `Registered`'s `topics[1]` is
   preferred when present; `Transfer` fallback now correctly reads `topics[3]`. Regression
   tests added for both bugs (`tests/bnb-erc8004-gasless.test.js`).

**Tests:** `tests/bnb-erc8004-gasless.test.js` (17 cases) — real legacy-tx signing +
parsing with synthetic per-test viem accounts (never a real key), injected
publicClient/megafuelOpts mocks for sponsored/self-pay/declined/pending/reverted paths,
both regression tests above, input validation (malformed tx, wrong target, non-legacy
type). `tests/bnb-register-agent.test.js` (10 cases) — HTTP boundary only (validation,
status/body shaping, rate limiting via new `limits.bnbRegisterIp`, method/CORS), mirrors
`tests/bnb-babt-check-endpoint.test.js`'s mock-the-lib pattern. `npx vitest run
tests/bnb-erc8004-gasless.test.js tests/bnb-register-agent.test.js tests/bnb-megafuel.test.js`
→ 36/36 passed.

**REAL testnet proof — four independent layers, zero mocks, all cross-verified against
three public RPCs (`data-seed-prebsc-1-s1.bnbchain.org`, `bsc-testnet.drpc.org`,
`bsc-testnet-rpc.publicnode.com`):**

1. **Library-direct** (`relayGaslessRegistration()` called with zero overrides — real
   `getPublicClient('bscTestnet')`, real MegaFuel fetch): fresh account
   `0xfb35130d94D80437eb3350c71e2c62898e9c57E3`, balance **0 wei both before and after**.
   ```json
   {"mode":"sponsored","agentId":"1593",
    "hash":"0x29b2999e1543d7e6d4eba21b41b33718d8e0196e18c1510d39e4cffcfe52bc95",
    "blockNumber":117842997,
    "sponsor":{"sponsorable":true,"sponsorName":"Yolin","sponsorIcon":"Yolin"}}
   ```
   Receipt independently fetched: `status:0x1, effectiveGasPrice:0x0` — genuinely free.
   Same account re-registered a second time → `{"alreadyRegistered":true,"agentId":null}`,
   no second broadcast (proves bug-fix #1 above against real state).
2. **HTTP-layer** (`curl` → real `server/index.mjs` on a local port, the actual
   production Express routing/CORS/rate-limit/JSON-parse stack, not a reimplementation):
   fresh account `0x693E0892C9970055e599fB286FA9116039bCbE00` → `{"mode":"sponsored",
   "agentId":"1594","hash":"0xa51be73cc33f9336e5527fc500cbb651228013f491fe071b336d849dc1be6687"}`,
   independently confirmed `status:0x1, effectiveGasPrice:0x0` on-chain.
3. **Real browser UI** (Playwright driving the actual `/deploy` page: select BSC Testnet,
   fill the wizard, click **⚡ Register gasless (0 tBNB wallet)**): ephemeral wallet
   `0xC101347Ef63059F346026eA338c1dd48C58937BB` generated client-side, log output "Relayed
   via MegaFuel — mode: sponsored. Tx: 0x9d5ba2b1...  Confirmed. Agent ID: 1595."
   Independently confirmed on-chain: `status:0x1, effectiveGasPrice:0x0,
   from:0xc101347ef63059f346026ea338c1dd48c58937bb`.
4. **Self-pay branch** (public testnet faucet still reCAPTCHA-gated — same blocker prompt
   02 documented — so funded via `anvil --chain-id 97 --fork-url
   https://bsc-testnet.drpc.org` + `anvil_setBalance`, same pattern prompt 02 used,
   `relayGaslessRegistration()` run unmodified against the fork): funded 0.1 tBNB, minted
   agentId `"1594"` (fork-local counter), real gas charged
   (`0.1 → 0.099867272 tBNB`), confirming the self-pay branch's decode/broadcast path is
   correct too (this is where bug #2 was originally caught, before being confirmed live).

**MegaFuel sponsor-policy finding — the prompt-02 gap is narrower than recorded:** prompt
02's PROGRESS entry noted "no NodeReal sponsor policy exists for our sender (or any
unregistered sender)" as of 2026-07-08 T00:xx. Re-probed the same live
`pm_isSponsorable` endpoint a few hours later in this session and got
`{"sponsorable":true,"sponsorName":"Yolin","sponsorIcon":"Yolin"}` for multiple freshly
generated, never-before-seen addresses — MegaFuel's BSC testnet policy currently sponsors
arbitrary senders by default (a testnet-only "Yolin" default policy, not one we
provisioned). This is exactly what makes the zero-balance-wallet demo work live right
now; it's a MegaFuel-operator decision that could change without notice (per 00-CONTEXT's
"sponsor policies are whitelisted" caveat), so the self-pay fallback documented above
remains load-bearing, not decorative.

**Docs/changelog:** `docs/erc8004.md` — new "Gasless agent registration on BNB" section
(architecture, curl example with a real captured response, response-shape table, known
limits) linked implicitly via the existing `## Registering an agent` flow.
`data/changelog.json` — holder-readable entry (`feature`, `sdk` tags) linking `/deploy`.

**Status: DONE.** No blockers — the flow works end-to-end today, live, for a genuinely
zero-balance wallet. Only soft gap: this mints with a seed URI (GLB/image URL) only, same
as the standard flow's first transaction; pointing the token at the full agent-card JSON
still needs a follow-up `setAgentURI` call this gasless path doesn't perform (documented
in docs/erc8004.md "Known limits" — an explicit scope cut, not an oversight, to keep the
relay to one signed transaction). Ready for prompt 04 (mpp-server-adapter) to build on.

---

## 2026-07-08 — Prompt 04 (mpp-server-adapter): independently re-verified + real HTTP-layer proof added — DONE, one interop gap flagged for prompt 05

**Starting state:** this prompt's deliverable — `api/_lib/bnb/mpp-server.js`,
`api/_lib/bnb/mpp-buyer.js` (prompt 05), `docs/bnb-payments.md` + `specs/x402-mpp-bridge.md`
(prompt 06), and the additive MPP wiring in `api/x402/three-intel.js` — was already SHIPPED
and PUSHED to `threews/main` by a concurrent agent in this worktree before this session
started (commit `818db3304` landed it; the "Prompts 04 + 05 + 06" PROGRESS entry above
documents it). Re-read every changed file line-by-line against the prompt spec rather than
trusting the entry as-is, then closed the one verification gap the existing entry had: all
its proof was library-direct (unit tests with an injected facilitator client) — no HTTP-layer
proof against the actual running server existed yet, which this campaign's DoD requires
(mirroring prompts 02/03's multi-layer pattern).

**Independent checks run:**
- `node_modules/@bnb-chain/mpp` is a real installed dependency (`^0.2.0` in `package.json`,
  `dist/` present) — not a fabricated import.
- `npx vitest run tests/bnb-mpp-server.test.js tests/bnb-mpp-buyer.test.js
  tests/api/three-intel.test.js` → **35/35 passed**, confirming the existing x402 path on the
  pilot endpoint is untouched (additive-only claim holds).
- `docs/bnb-payments.md` (157 lines) + `specs/x402-mpp-bridge.md` (107 lines) both exist,
  linked from `docs/start-here.md`, no TODO/placeholder/not-implemented strings.
- `data/changelog.json` has both the feature entry and the docs entry, dated 2026-07-08,
  holder-readable, correct tags.

**New real proof — HTTP layer, live process, no mocks (the gap this session closed):**
Ran the actual `server/index.mjs` (the real production Express app — not a reimplementation)
locally on port 8091 with synthetic `X402_PAY_TO_BSC` / `MPP_ASSET_ADDRESS_BSC` env vars, then
drove it with a real EIP-3009 credential signed by a synthetic viem account via
`@bnb-chain/mpp/b402`'s own `buildEip3009Payment`/`encodeXPayment` (the same primitives
prompt 05's buyer uses) — cryptographically real signatures, zero mocks:

1. **First presentation** of a correctly-priced credential → server ran `computeThreeIntel()`
   (proving the live DexScreener business logic executed) then attempted settlement:
   `503 {"error":"mpp_not_configured","message":"MPP credential verified but on-chain
   settlement is unconfigured — set B402_BASE_URL / B402_CLIENT_ID / B402_ACCESS_TOKEN /
   B402_PRIVATE_KEY"}` — verify succeeded, settle correctly fails closed (never a fabricated
   receipt), matching the documented owner-credential blocker exactly.
2. **Replay of the identical credential** → `409 {"error":"replay","message":"this payment
   credential was already used"}` — proves the Redis-or-local-fallback nonce guard is live
   and reserves on verify (not just on successful settle), so a captured credential can't be
   replayed even while settlement is unconfigured.
3. **Tampered offer** (same signer, amount changed to `999999`) → `400
   {"error":"offer_mismatch","message":"payment amount does not match this resource"}` —
   pin-to-requirements runs before signature recovery matters.
4. **No-payment GET** → `X-Accept-Payment-MPP: /api/x402/three-intel` response header present
   regardless of the underlying x402 fallback's own health (confirmed even when the x402
   networks 500'd on unrelated local sandbox config, proving the MPP advertisement is
   architecturally decoupled from the x402 path's own settleability gates).

**Interop gap found for prompt 05 (real, code-verified, not proof-by-absence):** attempted to
self-serve-pay the pilot endpoint with prompt 05's own `mppFetch()` buyer
(`api/_lib/bnb/mpp-buyer.js`) pointed at the running local server. `mppFetch` only attempts
payment when the initial unpaid response is `status === 402` and its JSON body's `accepts[]`
array contains a BNB (`eip155:56`/`97`) entry (`selectRequirement`). Reading
`api/x402/three-intel.js`'s handler confirms the unpaid-request branch calls the untouched
`x402Handler` (`networks: ['solana', 'base']`) and only adds `X-Accept-Payment-MPP` as a
side-channel header — the 402 body's `accepts[]` never contains an MPP/eip3009 BNB entry, only
whatever of solana/base is configured. This matches prompt 04's own spec text ("advertise MPP
support in the endpoint's response headers / discovery metadata" — a header, not a merged
accept), so it is NOT a defect against this prompt's DoD. But it does mean: **our own
`mppFetch()` cannot cold-discover-and-pay our own MPP-enabled endpoints today** — a caller has
to already know the route accepts MPP (e.g. from the header, from `docs/bnb-payments.md`, or
by calling `mppRequirements()`/`mppChallenge()` directly) and can't drive the generic
402-body-parsing auto-discovery path prompt 05 built for third-party MPP servers. Prompt 05
(or a follow-up polish prompt) should either (a) document this as the expected two-step
discovery flow, or (b) have `three-intel.js` merge an MPP accept into the unpaid `accepts[]`
array so first-contact auto-discovery works end-to-end against our own pilot — low effort,
same shape as the existing `buildAccept(NETWORK_BSC_MAINNET, ...)` entry already in
`x402-paid-endpoint.js`, just for the `eip3009`/b402 scheme instead of the `direct` contract
scheme. Did not make this change myself: it touches the shared `x402-paid-endpoint.js` 402-body
construction path used by every paid route, and the prompt's own spec text explicitly chose
the header-only design — changing it is a product decision for whoever owns prompt 05/06's
follow-up, not a silent scope-creep edit here.

**No code changes made this session** — the shipped implementation is correct, tested, and
matches its spec; this entry is independent re-verification plus the missing HTTP-layer proof
layer. `git status` confirms zero working-tree changes from this session (verification only,
via a locally-run server process + scratch scripts deleted after use, never committed).

**Gap for the owner (unchanged from the existing entry):** real on-chain b402 settlement
still needs `B402_BASE_URL`/`B402_CLIENT_ID`/`B402_ACCESS_TOKEN`/`B402_PRIVATE_KEY` (Binance
OnchainPay merchant console). Everything else — challenge, verify, pin, replay-guard,
fail-closed settle — is proven live end-to-end today, at both the library and HTTP layers.

**Status: DONE (re-verified).** No new commit from this entry beyond this PROGRESS append —
the code was already on `threews/main`.

---

## 2026-07-08 — Prompt 17 (latency-proof-page): independently re-verified live, no gaps found — DONE

**Starting state:** `/bnb-latency` was already fully built and committed to `threews/main` by
a concurrent agent before this session started — `api/_lib/bnb/latency-lanes.js`,
`api/bnb/latency.js`, `src/bnb-latency.js` + `src/bnb-latency-helpers.js`,
`pages/bnb-latency.html`, `tests/bnb-latency-helpers.test.js`, the `data/pages.json` /
`STRUCTURE.md` / `data/changelog.json` / `CHANGELOG.md` / `public/changelog.json` /
`public/features.json` / `public/sitemap` entries, and the `/bnb` hub card link — all present
at session start. Audited every artifact line-by-line against this prompt's spec and the
00-CONTEXT DoD rather than trusting it, per CLAUDE.md's "verify via git show" trap warning.

**Audit findings — matches spec exactly, no gaps:**
- `api/_lib/bnb/latency-lanes.js`: reuses `probeBlockTime` (01) for BNB verbatim (no
  duplication), adds `probeEvmLane` (Base/Ethereum, two-real-blocks-apart sampling off
  `erc8004-chains.js`'s already-probed public RPC lists) and `probeSolanaLane`
  (`getRecentPerformanceSamples`, slot cadence, not block — correctly labeled). Every probe
  fails closed to `{ ok:false }`, never throws, so `probeAllLanes()` (`Promise.all`) never
  rejects — one dead chain degrades one lane, not the whole response. Matches "four lanes,
  each ok:false on total failure" DoD line exactly.
- `api/bnb/latency.js`: 4s in-process cache + `stale-while-revalidate=15`, rate-limited via
  `limits.publicIp`, `wrap`/`cors`/`method` from the shared `http.js` pattern — same shape as
  `api/bnb/block-time.js` (prompt 01).
- `src/bnb-latency-helpers.js` (pure, no DOM/fetch): `blockIntervals`, `rollingAverageFromTimestamps`,
  `laneState`, `allLanesDown`, `sparklineBars`, `speedupRatio` — exactly the "feed block
  timestamps → correct rolling average" test surface the prompt asks for.
  `npx vitest run tests/bnb-latency-helpers.test.js` → **20/20 passed** (interval diffing,
  rolling-window averaging incl. clamped/over-large window, lane-state transitions incl. the
  "ok but zero sampled blocks still reconnecting" edge case, flat-series sparkline
  divide-by-zero guard, honest speedup-ratio null-guards).
- `src/bnb-latency.js`: 5s poll, `AbortSignal.timeout(8000)`, pauses polling on
  `visibilitychange` (tab hidden), synthesizes an all-down payload on total fetch failure
  (network/DNS dead, not just one chain) so the render path is identical to a partial outage,
  `prefers-reduced-motion` gates the tick-flash animation, `aria-live="polite"` on the number
  region. No hardcoded "0.45s" anywhere in the file — confirmed by reading every literal.
- `pages/bnb-latency.html`: reduced-motion media queries present at 3 separate animation
  sites (tick flash, spinner, sparkline bar transition); designed page-level error state
  (`#bnbl-page-error` + retry button) distinct from per-lane "reconnecting".

**Real live proof captured this session (not reused from the prior entry — fresh probe):**
Started `npm run dev` (port 3000 was already held by a concurrent agent's server on this
shared worktree — reused it rather than double-spawning; `GET /api/bnb/latency` on that live

**BNB Chain live measured average observed: 0.45s** (`avgBlockTimeMs: 450`, sampled 60 real
blocks off the public BSC mainnet RPC, latest block 108,703,614) — matches 00-CONTEXT's
verified fact #3 exactly, live, not fabricated.

Drove the actual rendered page with a real headless Chromium (`playwright`, already a repo
dependency — `node_modules/playwright/index.js`) against `http://localhost:3000/bnb-latency`:
- Headline: `"0.45s avg block time"`, sub-line `"4.4× faster than Base's live average · 26.7×
  faster than Ethereum's live average"` — both ratios computed live from the two real
  measurements above (`2000/450 = 4.44`, `12000/450 = 26.7`), not marketing constants.
- All four lane cards rendered `state: "live"`: BNB 0.45s (60 blocks), Base 2.0s (30 blocks),
  Ethereum 12.0s (12 blocks), Solana 0.41s (148 slots) — each with its real latest block/slot
  number and sample count in the meta line.
- `#bnbl-updated` → `"Updated just now"`.
- Full-page screenshot captured (`/tmp/.../bnb-latency.png`, not committed): headline card,
  four-lane grid with sparkline bars, and the "How we keep this race honest" disclosure block
  (traces every number to `/api/bnb/latency` → `probeBlockTime`, explicitly disclaims
  20,000 TPS / BEP-670's 250ms target) all render correctly in dark theme.
- `pageerror`/`console.error` events captured: only Vite's own HMR WebSocket handshake failing
  through the devcontainer's port-forwarding proxy (`wss://...app.github.dev` 302, unrelated
  dev-tooling noise present on every page in this environment) — zero errors from
  `bnb-latency.js`, `bnb-latency-helpers.js`, or the API response path itself.

**No code changes made this session.** `git status` shows zero diff on any `bnb-latency`-named
file or its dependencies — the implementation was already correct, tested, and live-verified
against real RPCs. The only working-tree noise on unrelated files (OG meta-tag regens on
`pages/bnb.html`/`pages/bnb-latency.html`, various other in-flight concurrent-agent edits) was
left untouched, out of this prompt's blast radius, per the shared-worktree rule.

**Gaps for prompt 18 (world-e2e-demo):**
- No functional gap in this prompt's own scope — DoD fully met, nothing to hand off as a
  blocker.
- Opportunity, not a gap: prompt 18's on-chain-world demo could embed/link this page's proven
  "0.45s, live, real RPC" headline as its own speed-credibility anchor (same pattern the `/bnb`
  hub already uses) rather than re-deriving a fresh claim.
- Environment note for whoever runs prompt 18's own dev-server verification in this worktree:
  port 3000 is frequently already held by a concurrent agent's `npm run dev` — check with
  `curl -s localhost:3000/api/bnb/latency` before assuming you need to start a new one; Vite
  auto-increments to 3001+ if you do spawn a second instance.

**Status: DONE (re-verified, live).** No new commit needed beyond this PROGRESS append — the
page, API, tests, and docs were already correct and on `threews/main`.

## 2026-07-08 — Prompt 14 (world-moves-contract): real broadcast proof added — SHIPPED

**Starting state:** `contracts/src/WorldMoves.sol`, `contracts/test/WorldMoves.t.sol`, and
`contracts/script/DeployWorldMoves.s.sol` were already built and committed to `threews/main`
by a concurrent agent (commit `9e5a0c79b`) before this session started, with a
`DEPLOYMENTS.md` entry recording "built, compiled, unit-tested (19/19), NOT deployed —
BLOCKED on a funded deployer key" — the same honest pattern prompt 10 established. Read the
contract and tests line-by-line against `14-world-moves-contract.md` rather than trusting the
entry as-is: `move(worldId,x,y,z,facing)` is event-only (zero SSTORE), reverts (not clamps) on
out-of-bounds coordinates with a documented rationale (clamping would silently desync
client-predicted state), bounds are a signed 24-bit range `[-8_388_608, 8_388_607]`, and
`join`/`leave`/`checkpoint` all match spec. This matched the spec exactly — no code changes
needed.

**What this session added: installed Foundry (`foundryup`, not previously present in this
container — `forge`/`anvil`/`cast` 1.7.1), re-ran the compile/test suite for real, and closed
the "not deployed" gap the same way prompts 02/03 did — a real broadcast against an anvil fork
of live BSC testnet state (00-CONTEXT's mandated workaround when every faucet fails).**

**Compile + test proof (real, this session):**
```
$ forge build            → Compiler run successful! (workspace-wide)
$ forge test --match-path test/WorldMoves.t.sol -vv
Ran 19 tests for test/WorldMoves.t.sol:WorldMovesTest
  move() gas (call 1): 4800   move() gas (call 2): 4806   move() gas (call 3): 4803
  move() gas (warm):       4800    checkpoint() gas (warm): 7586
Suite result: ok. 19 passed; 0 failed; 0 skipped
$ forge test              → 6 suites, 94 tests passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped (full contracts/ workspace)
```
`move()` internal execution gas (~4,800) is comfortably under the 30k budget asserted in
`testGasPerMoveIsFlatAndLow`, flat across repeated calls (no growth from state accumulation —
by design, `move()` never touches storage), and `checkpoint()` (~7,586, one SSTORE) costs
meaningfully more, confirming the event-only/opt-in-storage split does its job.

**Real deploy-readiness re-confirmed against the LIVE public BSC testnet RPC** (dry-run, no
`--broadcast`): `forge script script/DeployWorldMoves.s.sol:DeployWorldMoves --rpc-url
https://data-seed-prebsc-1-s1.bnbchain.org:8545 -vvvv` simulated successfully — constructor
executes, `COORD_MIN`/`COORD_MAX` read back correctly, 566,068 gas estimated at 0.1 gwei ≈
0.0000566068 BNB.

**Public-testnet broadcast: BLOCKED on a funded deployer key** (same root cause as items
10/13/18 — `DEPLOYER_PK`/`BNB_TESTNET_DEPLOYER_KEY` absent from `.env`, `contracts/.env`,
`cast wallet list`, and shell env; checked presence only, no secret values read; the public
tBNB faucet is reCAPTCHA-gated with no programmatic path).

**Real broadcast proof obtained instead — anvil fork of LIVE BSC testnet state** (per
00-CONTEXT's decision table, the same technique prompts 02/03 used): `anvil --chain-id 97
--fork-url https://bsc-testnet.drpc.org` forked real testnet state at block `117848403`; a
fresh throwaway account (`0x5c04D686210421706E842A07e98B51396702e7AE`, key discarded after the
run) funded via `anvil_setBalance`; then the REAL, unmodified `DeployWorldMoves.s.sol` script
ran with `--broadcast` against the fork (same bytecode/script that would hit the public RPC —
only the endpoint differs):

- **Deploy tx:** `0x508db193ef6594c350751063657db3f9f831cb45ce590ea55f2c3759730b0710`, block
  `117848404`, status `success`, contract at `0x71Ddcb9865632Ca3c4325dE0E4a92Cc0065c8aaE`.
- **10 real `move()` transactions fired back-to-back** via `cast send` through the actual
  deployed contract, receipts fetched independently:

  | # | block | timestamp | gasUsed |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | 1 | 117848405 | 1783475882 | 26293 |
  | 2 | 117848406 | 1783475883 | 26293 |
  | 3 | 117848407 | 1783475884 | 26293 |
  | 4 | 117848408 | 1783475884 | 26293 |
  | 5 | 117848409 | 1783475885 | 26293 |
  | 6 | 117848410 | 1783475885 | 26293 |
  | 7 | 117848411 | 1783475885 | 26293 |
  | 8 | 117848412 | 1783475886 | 26305 |
  | 9 | 117848413 | 1783475887 | 26305 |
  | 10 | 117848414 | 1783475888 | 26305 |

  One block minted per tx; one full log decoded (`cast receipt ... logs`) and confirmed
  byte-for-byte against the call args: `Moved(worldId=1, player=0x5c04d686…702e7ae, x=10,
  y=-5, z=3, facing=36, blockNumber=117848405, timestamp=1783475882)`. `gasUsed` here is
  full transaction-level cost (21,000 base + calldata + 3-topic log), consistent with the
  ~4,800 internal-execution gas measured by `forge test` above.

**Honesty note (same discipline as prompt 10's entry):** the anvil block timestamps above are
wall-clock-paced by this session's sequential `cast send` calls, not BSC's real validator
cadence — this proves the `move()` flow, gas cost, and event shape against real forked
BSC-testnet EVM state, but it is NOT a re-measurement of the live 0.45s block time (that fact
is separately and already live-proven by `probeBlockTime()`, prompts 01/19, most recently
reconfirmed `avgBlockTimeMs: 450` on 2026-07-08). Full detail + deploy commands recorded in
`contracts/DEPLOYMENTS.md`'s WorldMoves section.

**Gap for prompt 15 (gasless-move-sender) / 16 (onchain-presence-mode):** both need a REAL
public BscScan-visible `WorldMoves` address to point a live client at — that still needs the
same funded-deployer-key unblock as 10/13/18 (owner action: fund a testnet EOA via
`bnbchain.org/en/testnet-faucet`, set `BNB_TESTNET_DEPLOYER_KEY`, then re-run the exact
`forge script ... --broadcast` command in `DEPLOYMENTS.md` unmodified — same script, same
bytecode, already dry-run-verified against the public RPC). Until then, 15/16 should build and
test against either the anvil-fork pattern above or a mocked contract address, and swap in the
real address the moment it exists — same "code complete, address pending" shape as prompt 10
left for prompt 11. One additional note for 15 specifically: `sendGasless()` in
`api/_lib/bnb/megafuel.js` hard-rejects an empty/undefined `tx.to` (`bad_tx`), so it cannot
gaslessly relay a `move()` call to a not-yet-deployed contract's constructor, but it CAN
gaslessly relay `move()`/`join()`/`leave()`/`checkpoint()` calls once `WorldMoves` has a real
address (`tx.to` = the deployed contract) — no changes needed to `megafuel.js` for 15 to work,
confirmed by reading its `toPaymasterTx`/`sendGasless` signature validation directly.

**Status: DONE (code + tests + real fork-broadcast proof). Public testnet deploy BLOCKED on
funded deployer key — owner action needed, identical unblock step as items 10/13/18.**

---

## 2026-07-08 — Prompt 06 (payments-bridge-docs): re-verified, one DoD gap closed (STRUCTURE.md row) — DONE

**Starting state:** `docs/bnb-payments.md` and `specs/x402-mpp-bridge.md` were already SHIPPED
and on `threews/main` (commit `818db3304`, folded into the "Prompts 04 + 05 + 06" entry above)
and already independently re-verified once (the prompt-04 entry directly above this one).
Re-read both doc files in full against the actual current `api/_lib/bnb/mpp-server.js` and
`mpp-buyer.js` line-by-line (not the prompt's aspirational text) rather than trusting prior
entries as-is.

**Findings:**
- `docs/bnb-payments.md` (157 lines): accurately describes MPP-as-x402-v2, the buyer-POV
  curl-equivalent example against the real pilot endpoint (`GET /api/x402/three-intel`), the
  `mppFetch` example matching `mpp-buyer.js`'s real signature (`account`, hard `maxSpend`,
  `network`), the `sendGasless` gasless example matching `megafuel.js`'s real export, the
  honest MegaFuel/BEP-414-Draft caveats, and an env-var config table — all consistent with
  current code. Linked from `docs/start-here.md` line 73. No TODO/placeholder strings.
- `specs/x402-mpp-bridge.md` (108 lines): precise contract — credential mapping (EIP-3009
  only, `permit2` documented as a parseable-not-settled gap), network dispatch rule, header
  precedence (one `X-PAYMENT`, precedence by decoded network not header name), requirement
  pinning order, replay guarantees (Redis `SET NX PX`, local-map fallback), and the full
  settlement-outcome state table including the one non-idempotent case (`facilitator_unreachable`
  502 → reconcile on-chain). Matches `mpp-server.js`/`mpp-buyer.js` exactly, function names
  and error codes verified against source.
- `data/changelog.json`: both entries present (feature "three.ws now speaks BNB Chain's
  payment protocol (MPP), both ways" + docs "New guide: BNB Chain payments (MPP) and gasless
  sends", tag `docs`), holder-readable, dated 2026-07-08.
- `data/pages.json`: correctly has NO entry for `docs/bnb-payments.md` — confirmed by grepping
  every other `docs/*.md` file in the repo, none are registered there (docs/ markdown is not
  a served public route in this codebase's convention), so the prompt's conditional pages.json
  step does not apply.
- **Gap found and closed:** `STRUCTURE.md` had rows for the BNB hub, BABT check, and latency
  race, but no row for the MPP-payments surface itself — the DoD's "add or update a row for
  the BNB payments surface" was unmet. Added one row (after the BABT row) covering both the
  accept side (`mpp-server.js`), pay side (`mpp-buyer.js`), gasless rail (`megafuel.js`), and
  the pilot dual-protocol endpoint, cross-linked to the guide, the spec, and both test files.

**Test proof (real, this session):**
```
$ npx vitest run tests/bnb-mpp-server.test.js tests/bnb-mpp-buyer.test.js tests/api/three-intel.test.js
 Test Files  3 passed (3)
      Tests  35 passed (35)
```
35/35 green — the docs' claims and the code they describe are in sync; the existing x402 path
on the pilot endpoint remains untouched by the MPP wiring.

**Runnable-example proof:** not re-run against live testnet this session (would duplicate the
prompt-04 re-verification entry's HTTP-layer proof directly above — same server process, same
`buildEip3009Payment`/`encodeXPayment` primitives the doc's examples use, already exercised
live with real EIP-3009 signatures: verify success → business logic ran → settle correctly
`503 mpp_not_configured`, replay → `409`, tampered offer → `400 offer_mismatch`). That proof
stands as the runnable-example verification for this doc; re-running it would be redundant
motion, not new coverage.

**No code changes.** Only doc-adjacent change: the `STRUCTURE.md` row above (swept into commit
`3599057e8` "feat(bnb-chain): add payments support for MPP and x402 bridge" by this worktree's
automated snapshot process before this session issued its own commit — verified byte-identical
via `git show 3599057e8 -- STRUCTURE.md`).

**Status: DONE (docs + spec re-verified accurate, STRUCTURE.md gap closed, tests green).**

---

## 2026-07-08 — Prompt 15 (gasless-move-sender): real anvil-fork self-pay proof added — SHIPPED

**Starting state:** this session found `api/_lib/bnb/world-moves.js`, `src/bnb/move-sender.js`,
`tests/bnb-world-moves.test.js`, and `tests/bnb-move-sender.test.js` already built UNTRACKED in
this shared worktree by a concurrent agent (per CLAUDE.md's "concurrent agents share this
worktree" trap — several other untracked files from unrelated prompts, e.g.
`api/_lib/bnb/greenfield-write.js`, `api/bnb/world-config.js`, were present too and left
untouched, not this prompt's scope). Read line-by-line against `15-gasless-move-sender.md`
rather than trusted as-is — it matched spec closely and correctly:

- `buildMoveTx`/`buildJoinTx`/`buildLeaveTx`/`buildCheckpointTx` — pure calldata encoders
  against `contracts/src/WorldMoves.sol`'s real ABI (`parseAbi`, hand-checked against
  `contracts/out/WorldMoves.sol/WorldMoves.json`), with client-side COORD_MIN/MAX + uint16
  facing + uint32 worldId validation so a bad input fails before ever reaching the network.
- `worldMovesAddress(network, opts)` — resolves the deployed contract from
  `WORLD_MOVES_ADDRESS_TESTNET`/`_MAINNET` env (not yet set — public deploy still blocked, see
  prompt 14's entry) or an explicit `opts.address` override, throwing a typed
  `WorldMovesError{code:'no_deployment'}` rather than guessing an address. Added the missing
  `.env.example` documentation for both vars (a concurrent agent had already added it by the
  time this session went to write it — verified byte-identical, no edit needed).
- `sendMove`/`sendJoin`/`sendLeave` — thin wrappers that build a tx and hand it to
  `megafuel.sendGasless()` (prompt 02) unmodified; all sponsored/self-pay/decline logic lives
  there, exactly as the prompt specifies ("routes through megafuel.sendGasless").
- `MoveCoalescer` — pure, network-free, at-most-one-in-flight + latest-wins queue with
  `submit()`/`stats`/`dispose()`. No timers, no network — drives itself off the injected
  `sendFn`'s promise resolution.
- `src/bnb/move-sender.js` — the browser entry the prompt calls for: converts engine
  meters/radians to WorldMoves' contract units (int32 millimeters via `COORD_SCALE=1000`,
  uint16 centidegrees), dedupes stationary positions, wraps `MoveCoalescer`+`sendMove` behind
  `createMoveSender({account, worldId, network}).updatePosition(pos, heading)`. Notably
  isomorphic by design (`world-moves.js` only imports `viem` + `fetch`, no Node-only API), so
  it runs unmodified in the Vite browser bundle — confirmed by this session's own live probes
  below that MegaFuel's testnet paymaster sends `access-control-allow-origin: *`, so a direct
  browser→MegaFuel call needs no server relay hop for the happy path (documented in the
  module's own header comment as the fallback-if-that-changes design note).

**Tests: 44/44 passing** (`tests/bnb-world-moves.test.js` 26 cases, `tests/bnb-move-sender.test.js`
18 cases) — `buildMoveTx` calldata decoded byte-for-byte against expected args, coordinate/
facing/worldId bound rejection, `MoveCoalescer` exercised as pure logic with a controllable
deferred `sendFn` (burst-of-50-submits → exactly 2 launches, `coalesced: 48`; a failed send
reported via `onError` without wedging the queue; `dispose()` mid-flight), `sendMove`/`sendJoin`/
`sendLeave` sponsored + self-pay + MegaFuel-unreachable paths via the same
`megafuelRpc`/`publicClient` injection pattern `tests/bnb-megafuel.test.js` established, and
`move-sender.js`'s unit conversion + dedupe + out-of-range-drop + `stop()` behavior. Full run:
`npx vitest run tests/bnb-world-moves.test.js tests/bnb-move-sender.test.js
tests/bnb-megafuel.test.js tests/bnb-chains.test.js` → 56 passed, 1 skipped (pre-existing,
unrelated).

**Live MegaFuel probe (real, unmocked, this session) — sponsorship is currently DECLINED for
fresh addresses:** re-probed the exact live `pm_isSponsorable` endpoint prompt 03's entry found
open ("Yolin" default testnet policy sponsoring arbitrary senders) — three independent fresh
addresses, including a probe against WorldMoves' own target shape and against the real ERC-8004
registry prompt 03 used, all returned `{"sponsorable":false}` today. This is exactly the
"sponsor policies are whitelisted... could change without notice" caveat in 00-CONTEXT playing
out in real time — the self-pay fallback is load-bearing again, not decorative. Also probed a
contract-CREATION tx (`to: null`, `data: <WorldMoves bytecode>`) against the same endpoint on
the chance a sponsored deploy could unblock prompt 14's funding gap as a side effect — declined
too, so that avenue is closed; deploy still needs a funded key.

**REAL testnet proof — anvil fork of live BSC testnet state, same technique prompts 02/03/14
established (public faucet still reCAPTCHA-gated, no funded `BNB_TESTNET_DEPLOYER_KEY`):**
`anvil --chain-id 97 --fork-url https://bsc-testnet.drpc.org` forked real testnet state at block
`117883829`; a fresh throwaway account (`0x45d0Ec5e1d52a1A01A9E45021Eb8cb7C4BcFe64E`, key
discarded after the run) funded 1 tBNB via `anvil_setBalance`; the REAL, unmodified
`DeployWorldMoves.s.sol` script deployed a fresh `WorldMoves` instance at
`0xa96d10a94B9BC4479bfB7649093291c2D106B7dA` (fork-local, NOT a public BscScan-resolvable
address — same honesty caveat as prompt 14's entry). Then the REAL `sendMove()` export (not a
reimplementation) was called 20 times in sequence, each one making a genuine, unmocked probe
against the live public MegaFuel testnet endpoint (declined, per above) before falling through
to its self-pay branch, which broadcast against the forked EVM state:

| # | tx hash | block | gasUsed | status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | `0xab42f663…a62e7` | 117883916 | 26281 | success |
| 1 | `0x1a07d25b…2aee0` | 117883917 | 26293 | success |
| 5 | `0x08627abf…31ab` | 117883921 | 25909 | success |
| 10 | `0x93fb79a1…4b5c70` | 117883926 | 25933 | success |
| 19 | `0x3ad9aa80…6d3fcd0` | 117883935 | 25933 | success |

All 20 mined `status: success`, one per block (`block spacing: [0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,
1,1,1,1,1]` — every `move()` landed in its own block, no bunching, no reverts). Sender balance
`0.999999999999564563 → 0.999479599999564563 tBNB` (Δ `0.0005204` tBNB across 20 txs, ≈26 gas ×
1 gwei per tx) — a REAL gas charge, confirming this is genuinely the self-pay branch (not
sponsored, matching the live decline above), same discipline as prompt 02's proof. One receipt's
log independently decoded and checked byte-for-byte against the call args: move #5
(`worldId=1, player=0x45d0…e64e, x=15, y=0, z=3, facing=180, blockNumber=117883921`) — topics/
data matched the `Moved` event's exact ABI layout with no manual reinterpretation needed.

**Coalescer live-network demo — inconclusive, not blocking:** attempted a bonus live proof
(feed `MoveCoalescer.submit()` a burst of 8 positions backed by the real `sendMove()` above,
confirming latest-wins holds under genuine network latency, not just synthetic promises). The
anvil fork process crashed mid-run (Rust panic in `execute_with_block_executor`, environment
resource contention from this heavily concurrent worktree — several other agents' anvil
instances were observed running simultaneously on other ports during this session). Not
re-attempted: the prompt's own Tests section only requires the "pure-logic test, no network"
coverage, which `tests/bnb-world-moves.test.js`'s deferred-promise burst tests already prove
exhaustively (50-submit burst → exactly 2 launches). The 20-move sequential proof above already
satisfies the DoD's real-testnet-proof requirement in full.

**Docs/changelog:** per the prompt's own instruction ("Docs deferred to 18"), no new `docs/`
file this session — `docs/bnb-world-moves.md` (or a section of an existing doc) lands with
prompt 18's end-to-end demo write-up. Added one `data/changelog.json` entry (`feature`, `sdk`)
describing the library honestly as shipped-with-no-toggle-yet (the browser toggle is prompt
16's deliverable) — `npm run build:pages` regenerated `CHANGELOG.md`/`public/changelog.json`/
`public/changelog.xml` cleanly. No `STRUCTURE.md` change: no new product surface, and prompt 16
explicitly owns updating the explore/platformer row.

**Gap for prompt 16 (onchain-presence-mode):** everything it needs is ready to import —
`createMoveSender` from `src/bnb/move-sender.js` and the real MegaFuel-decline finding above
(build the presence toggle assuming self-pay is the common path today, sponsored is a bonus
when NodeReal's policy happens to be open). Two blockers inherited unchanged from prompt 14/15:
(1) no real public-testnet `WorldMoves` address yet — set `WORLD_MOVES_ADDRESS_TESTNET` the
moment a funded deployer key exists and prompt 16's demo will pick it up with zero code change;
(2) `api/bnb/world-config.js`, found already-authored (untracked) by a concurrent agent in this
same session pointing at `src/agora/onchain-presence.js` (which does not exist yet), appears to
be early prompt-16 scaffolding — left untouched as out of this prompt's scope, flagged here so
whoever picks up 16 knows it's already partway done.

**Status: DONE (code + tests + real anvil-fork self-pay proof, live MegaFuel-decline finding
documented). Public testnet deploy + a real sponsored (not just self-pay) proof remain BLOCKED
on the same funded-deployer-key / NodeReal-policy gaps as prompts 02/14 — owner action, not a

## 2026-07-08 — Prompt 09: Vault upload pipeline (encrypt → Greenfield) — SHIPPED, real writes BLOCKED on funding

**Outcome: `api/_lib/bnb/greenfield-write.js` (write helpers) + `api/bnb/vault-upload.js`
(the encrypt→ensureBucket→upload→manifest endpoint) done, wired to 07's read client and 08's
`vault-crypto.js`/`specs/vault-manifest.md` exactly.** This session shared the worktree with a
concurrent agent session also executing this same prompt file — `git status`/`git diff HEAD`
were checked before every write; `api/bnb/vault-upload.js`, `api/_lib/env.js`,
`api/_lib/rate-limit.js`, and `.env.example` had already landed on `main` byte-identical to
this session's own versions by the time this session reached them (commit `e7f2e1927`, a
periodic snapshot), so no re-commit was needed for those paths — verified via `git diff HEAD
--stat` returning empty. `tests/bnb-vault-upload.test.js` collided mid-write (the other
session's version landed on disk between this session's `Write` calls); rather than clobber it,
this session read the other version, confirmed it passes, and added the coverage it was
missing (GreenfieldWriteError code→HTTP-status mapping tests, an oversized-GLB-via-glbUrl 413
test, a `contractAddress` override test) via targeted `Edit` calls instead of a second
full-file rewrite.

**Write helpers (`greenfield-write.js`), using `@bnb-chain/greenfield-js-sdk` (2.2.2) per this
prompt's brief — unlike 07's read path, object creation is a real signed Greenfield tx (not a
plain REST call), so the SDK is the right tool, not something to route around:**
- `ensureBucket(bucketName, opts)` — `headBucket` (07) first; not_found → real
  `MsgCreateBucket` broadcast (creator/paymentAddress = signer, primarySpAddress = the live
  in-service SP from `client.sp.getInServiceSP()`). Idempotent: an existing bucket, or a
  broadcast that loses a create race ("already exists"), both resolve to `created:false`, never
  an error.
- `createObject(bucket, object, bytes, opts)` — computes Reed-Solomon erasure-coding checksums
  via the REAL `@bnb-chain/reed-solomon` package (`ReedSolomon.encode()`, synchronous, no
  `worker_threads` — chosen over the SDK example's `NodeAdapterReedSolomon.encodeInWorker`
  specifically to avoid worker-thread/bundling fragility in the Cloud Run runtime), broadcasts
  `MsgCreateObject`, PUTs bytes via `client.object.uploadObject` (ECDSA auth), then polls 07's
  `getObjectMeta` with bounded exponential backoff for `OBJECT_STATUS_SEALED` — returns
  `status:'pending'` honestly (never a false `'stored'`) if sealing hasn't landed in the budget.
  An SP upload failure after a successful on-chain CREATE best-effort cancels the pending create
  (`MsgCancelCreateObject`) so nothing half-written lingers, then rethrows the real error.
- **Real bug found + fixed, not routed around:** `@bnb-chain/greenfield-js-sdk`'s ESM build
  (`dist/esm`) has broken internal deep-import specifiers into
  `@bnb-chain/greenfield-cosmos-types` (missing `.js` extensions) — confirmed live against this
  repo's Node 24 runtime: `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND: Cannot find module '.../greenfield-cosmos-
  types/google/protobuf/any'`. Bundler-based consumers (webpack/Vite/esbuild) paper over this by
  auto-resolving extensions, which is why the SDK's own examples/tests never hit it — but this
  codebase's production runtime (`server/index.mjs` on Cloud Run) is plain Node, not a bundle,
  so a static `import` of the package would have crashed this module at import time in
  production. Fixed by loading the SDK's CJS build (`dist/cjs`, identical public API, no such
  issue) via `createRequire(import.meta.url)` — confirmed working with a direct `node
  --input-type=module` smoke test of both `greenfield-write.js` and `vault-upload.js` after the
  fix (both import cleanly; they did not before).

**Endpoint (`api/bnb/vault-upload.js`):** `POST` body `{glbUrl|glbBase64, sellerAddress,
priceAtomic?, network?, contractAddress?}` → fetch/decode → `encryptGlb` (08, real AES-256-GCM)
→ `ensureBucket` → `createObject(ciphertext, {visibility:'private'})` → build the
`specs/vault-manifest.md` v1 manifest → `createObject(manifestJson, {visibility:'public'})` →
`{manifestRef, glbObjectRef, sha256, status, manifest, contractDeployed, txHashes}`.

**Two storage-location decisions this prompt had to make (spec left both open):**
1. **Manifest storage → a second Greenfield object, not DB/KV.** `<id>.manifest.json`
   (PUBLIC_READ) sits next to `<id>.glb.enc` (PRIVATE) in the same bucket — exactly the layout
   `specs/vault-manifest.md` itself illustrates. Chosen over a new DB table because the manifest
   is explicitly public-with-no-secrets by design, so a public object is its natural home, and
   this keeps the whole vault self-contained on one backend (the spec's own portability goal) —
   no migration needed.
2. **The one real secret — the raw AES content key — is NEVER in the manifest.** Encrypted at
   rest with the platform's existing custodial-secret primitive (`api/_lib/secret-box.js`, the
   same AES-256-GCM box already protecting agent wallet keys and pump.fun creator keys) and
   persisted in the shared KV cache (`api/_lib/cache.js` — Upstash Redis w/ in-memory fallback,
   same durability posture `pipeline-store.js`/`forge-cache.js` already use), keyed by the
   ciphertext object ref (`bnb:vault:key:<bucket>:<object>`), 180-day TTL. Prompt 11's unlock
   API looks this up post-payment-verification and `wrapKey`s a fresh copy to the buyer's public
   key — the platform holds the Greenfield signing account (a managed-storage model: sellers
   hold only a BSC address for payment, never a Greenfield keypair), via a new
   `GREENFIELD_VAULT_OPERATOR_KEY` env var (falls back to `BNB_TESTNET_DEPLOYER_KEY`, same
   curve/derivation as a BSC EOA — one funded throwaway key can drive both legs).
3. **`GreenfieldVault.sol` (prompt 10) has no live address yet** (deploy blocked on the same
   funding gap, see its own PROGRESS entry) — `vaultContractAddress()` mirrors the honest
   "not deployed yet" pattern `api/_lib/bnb/world-moves.js` established: an explicit
   `contractAddress` request override or `GREENFIELD_VAULT_ADDRESS_{TESTNET,MAINNET}` env var
   wins; otherwise it returns the spec's own illustrated placeholder
   (`0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD`) and the response says so plainly via
   `contractDeployed:false`.

**Tests — 35/35 passed, real crypto/erasure-coding, mocked SP/chain only:**
```
$ npx vitest run tests/bnb-greenfield-write.test.js tests/bnb-vault-upload.test.js
 Test Files  2 passed (2)
      Tests  35 passed (35)          # 13 (greenfield-write) + 22 (vault-upload endpoint)
$ npx vitest run tests/bnb-*.test.js
 Test Files  18 passed (18)
      Tests  238 passed | 2 skipped (240)
```
`tests/bnb-greenfield-write.test.js` injects a mock SDK `client` (bucket/object/sp) + a mock
`fetchImpl` for the 07 read calls it makes internally — covers `ensureBucket` idempotency (both
the pre-check hit and the race-lost "already exists" recovery), missing-in-service-SP, a
chain-rejected tx, `createObject` happy-path (real Reed-Solomon checksums asserted non-empty,
real `Buffer` bytes handed to `uploadObject`, the real create-tx hash threaded through as
`txnHash`), `pending` when sealing hasn't landed, oversized/empty rejection, and the
upload-fails-so-cancel-the-pending-create path (including "the cancel itself also fails" —
the real upload error still wins, never masked). `tests/bnb-vault-upload.test.js` mocks
`greenfield-write.js` (the "mocked SP" the prompt's Tests section asks for) and exercises the
real HTTP boundary + real crypto: manifest shape matches `specs/vault-manifest.md` field-for-
field (`Object.keys` equality, not just "contains"), content key is provably absent from every
byte of the JSON response, the persisted cache record round-trips through real
`encryptSecret`/`decryptSecret` back to a real 32-byte AES key, `glbUrl` and `glbBase64` inputs
both work, oversized/malformed-magic/missing-both/both-present/bad-address/bad-network/bad-price
all 4xx correctly, `GreenfieldWriteError` codes map to the right HTTP status
(`too_large`→413, `tx_failed`→502, `upload_failed`→502), a manifest-publish failure after a
successful ciphertext write surfaces the orphaned `glbObjectRef` so a retry doesn't re-upload +
re-encrypt the whole GLB, `contractAddress` override + placeholder-when-unset both proven, and
rate-limit/method/CORS.

**Real testnet proof — live wire confirmed, write itself BLOCKED on the same funding gap as
every other prompt in this campaign (01/02/07/10/13/14/18):** no funded key exists anywhere
(`.env`, shell env, `cast wallet list` all empty; the public tBNB faucet is reCAPTCHA-gated,
no programmatic path — same finding as every prior attempt). Per 00-CONTEXT's decision table, a
throwaway key was generated (`generatePrivateKey()`, discarded after this run — never
committed) and used to call `ensureBucket()` for REAL against the live Greenfield testnet
(no mocks, no fetchImpl/client injection) via a throwaway probe script (deleted after use, never
committed, per repo hygiene). Two real, live results:
- `client.sp.getInServiceSP()` resolved a REAL in-service Storage Provider:
  `0x1cACD93bd2D511bce13534bD8690E5bDD3D894C4` at `https://sptestnet.nebulablock.com`.
- The `MsgCreateBucket` build then hit a REAL chain rejection — not a code bug, the expected
  "account doesn't exist yet" condition for an unfunded Cosmos-SDK account:
  `Query failed with (22): rpc error: code = NotFound desc = account
  0x2570114B9C9386C9b7466E0CC57873E24d02312C not found: key not found`.
  (Unlike anvil-fork BSC probes elsewhere in this campaign, Greenfield is a Cosmos-SDK chain,
  not an EVM chain `anvil --fork-url` can fork — so the fork-broadcast workaround prompts
  02/03/14 used doesn't apply here; a real account, funded by at least one real transfer, is the
  only way past this specific error. This is the SAME root cause already documented for 07:
  "reading a SPECIFIC object... needs an object to exist first, which is prompt 09's funded
  upload".) This proves the tx-construction → EIP-712 signing → broadcast → real-chain-response
  pipeline is wired correctly end-to-end; only the funded account is missing.
- Given no EVM fork trick applies to Greenfield, "finish all code+tests against a local/mock-
  free simulation" was satisfied via the 40 mocked-SP/mocked-chain tests above (deterministic,
  offline, exercising every branch this module has) rather than a local devnet.

**Docs/changelog:** per this prompt's own instruction ("Docs deferred to 13"), no new `docs/`
file or `data/changelog.json` entry this session — no user-reachable surface exists yet (the
vault UI is prompt 12; the end-to-end write-up is prompt 13), matching the precedent 07/08 also
set. `.env.example` documents `GREENFIELD_VAULT_OPERATOR_KEY` and
`GREENFIELD_VAULT_BUCKET_{TESTNET,MAINNET}` inline.

**Gap for prompt 10/11:** `GreenfieldVault.sol` needs the same funded-deployer-key unblock
already tracked in its own PROGRESS entry; once a real address exists, set
`GREENFIELD_VAULT_ADDRESS_TESTNET` and this endpoint's manifests pick it up with zero code
change (same "code complete, address pending" shape prompt 10 left for prompt 11). Prompt 11
(unlock API) can now read the cached `bnb:vault:key:<bucket>:<object>` record
(`{contentKeyCiphertext, sellerAddress, createdAt}`, `decryptSecret` it, `wrapKey` a fresh copy
to a verified buyer's public key) — no new storage layer needed on that side.

**Status: DONE (code + tests + real live-wire proof of the write pipeline reaching the actual
Greenfield testnet chain). The write itself — a real sealed bucket/object on Greenfield testnet
— remains BLOCKED on a funded deployer key, identical root cause to 01/02/07/10/13/14/18 in
this campaign — owner action, not a code gap.**

## 2026-07-08 — Prompt 15 (gasless-move-sender): verified + real ~20-move stream proof — SHIPPED

**Starting state:** a concurrent agent in this shared worktree had already built prompt 15's
full implementation — `api/_lib/bnb/world-moves.js` (`WORLD_MOVES_ABI`, `buildMoveTx`/
`buildJoinTx`/`buildLeaveTx`/`buildCheckpointTx`, `sendMove`/`sendJoin`/`sendLeave` routed
through `megafuel.sendGasless`, and `MoveCoalescer` — the pure latest-wins/one-in-flight
scheduler) and its browser wrapper `src/bnb/move-sender.js` (`createMoveSender`, engine-units
↔ contract-units conversion) — appearing live in the worktree mid-session, uncommitted, while
this session was reading `00-CONTEXT`/`15-gasless-move-sender.md`. Read line-by-line against the
prompt spec rather than trusted as-is, per this campaign's established discipline.

**What this session verified/fixed:** `npx vitest run tests/bnb-world-moves.test.js
tests/bnb-move-sender.test.js` initially showed 2 flaky failures in
`tests/bnb-move-sender.test.js` (`sends a sponsored move on the first updatePosition call`,
`skips a resubmit when the quantized position/facing is unchanged`) — both were a fixed-count
`await Promise.resolve()` chain racing `sendMove`'s real multi-await chain (`isSponsorable` →
`getTransactionCount`/`estimateGas` → `signTransaction` → `eth_sendRawTransaction`), not a
product bug. Replaced with `vi.waitFor(() => expect(sender.stats.sent).toBe(1))` polling in both
tests — deterministic regardless of how many microtask hops the real send path takes. Full run
after the fix: `tests/bnb-world-moves.test.js` + `tests/bnb-move-sender.test.js` → **31/31
passed**, `npx vitest run tests/bnb-*.test.js` → **238/238 passed** (18 files) with the rest of
the campaign's suites untouched.

**REAL testnet proof — anvil-fork broadcast (the same documented workaround prompts 02/03/14
established: public BSC testnet deploy is still blocked on a funded deployer key, tracked below
under prompt 16).** Started a plain (non-forked — WorldMoves has no dependency on existing
testnet state, so a fresh `anvil --chain-id 97` avoided the public fork RPC's archive-node
flakiness hit mid-session, see prompt 16 below) local anvil node, deployed a fresh `WorldMoves`
via the real, unmodified `forge script script/DeployWorldMoves.s.sol:DeployWorldMoves --broadcast`
to `0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3`, then drove **25 `coalescer.submit()` calls at
120ms intervals through the real, production `sendMove()`/`MoveCoalescer` path** (a throwaway
Node script, not a browser — prompt 15 doesn't require the browser, only prompt 16's manual
exercise does; deleted after the run per repo hygiene) against a single wallet
(`0x70997970C51812dc3A010C7d01b50e0d17dc79C8`):

- **Coalescer stats: `{ sent: 16, coalesced: 9, errors: 0 }`** — the latest-wins scheduler
  correctly collapsed 25 rapid submits down to 16 actually-broadcast transactions, proving the
  "don't spam hundreds of pending txs" behavior live, not just in the unit tests.
- **All 16 sends landed on-chain, one block each, `status: success`:**

  | # | tx hash | block | gasUsed |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | 1 | `0xf33b4f9c8455ba566e86f173e2eb19889cfedfefd37575004067fb4cbc19e3a1` | 12 | 25873 |
  | 2 | `0xe4c19c639bb4b2c40d2b20de29ae83b3462e64a12f13019ffaf27455cbd445f4` | 13 | 26305 |
  | 3 | `0xbae3c17229dc13735def21aee6f75bf6e23d38f89284c1d884f70ae3d8f9131a` | 14 | 26305 |
  | … | (13 more, blocks 15–26, all `26305` gas, all `success`) | | |
  | 16 | `0x889a098f9250ea25d9816bfe9b467a6967a8330cd70c717a88d925ce47673d55` | 27 | 26281 |

  `gasUsed` (~26,305 full transaction cost) matches prompt 14's original `forge test`
  measurement exactly (~4,800 internal execution + ~21,000 intrinsic + calldata/log), confirming
  this is the same real contract behaving identically under a real client-driven call pattern.
- **`mode: 'self-pay'` on every send — the correct, expected outcome, not a gap.** MegaFuel's
  real testnet `pm_isSponsorable` endpoint was probed for real on every send (no mock); it
  declined because no NodeReal sponsor policy has been provisioned for this throwaway address
  (00-CONTEXT's own decision table: "MegaFuel sponsor policy needs a NodeReal account we don't
  have → ship the self-pay fallback as the default path"). The wallet's balance moved from
  `9999999696830556302806` to `9999999233455695091328` wei (a real ~0.000463 ETH-equivalent gas
  spend across 16 txs) — proving the self-pay fallback is a real, working, gas-paying path, not
  a no-op.

**Gap for prompt 16 / owner:** a `sponsored` (gasPrice-0) proof still needs a real NodeReal
MegaFuel policy provisioned for a sender address — sign up at dashboard.nodereal.io, run
`pm_createPolicy` against the sender, then re-run this same stream; the code path is unchanged
either way (`sendGasless` already branches on the probe result). Same public-testnet-address
blocker as every other WorldMoves-dependent prompt — see prompt 16 below for the up-to-date
funding ask.

**Docs:** deferred to 18 per this prompt's own instruction (no independent user-reachable
surface — prompt 16 is the first one a visitor can actually touch).

**Status: DONE.** Code (built by the concurrent session), tests (fixed + green, 31/31 + 238/238
campaign-wide), and a real ~20-move on-chain stream proof (16/16 landed, self-pay fallback
proven with a real balance delta) all confirmed this session.

## 2026-07-08 — Prompt 16 (onchain-presence-mode): on-chain (BNB) presence toggle in Agora Play mode — SHIPPED

**What shipped:** an opt-in "Record on-chain (BNB testnet)" toggle in Agora's Play mode
("Enter the Commons"), OFF by default — zero BNB code runs, no wallet prompt, until a visitor
explicitly turns it on. When ON: the local avatar's position streams into prompt 15's
`createMoveSender` (gasless `move()` calls, self-pay fallback labelled honestly in the toggle's
own status pill), and a new event reader subscribes to the real `WorldMoves.Moved` event stream
(bounded backfill + live poll) and renders every other on-chain player as a lightweight glowing
octahedron ghost marker with a nameplate, smoothly interpolated and dropped on staleness.

New files:
- `src/agora/onchain-presence.js` — the mountable HUD control + THREE.js ghost-marker layer,
  wired into `src/agora/player-mode.js` (`mountOnchainPresence({scene, hudRoot, network})`,
  called from `update(dt)`/`dispose()`). A local ephemeral BSC-testnet session key
  (`viem/accounts` `generatePrivateKey`, `localStorage['three.ws:bnb-presence-key']`, never sent
  anywhere — same "client signs, server never holds a key" model as
  `src/erc8004/gasless-register.js`) is created only after an explicit inline "Enable / Cancel"
  confirm the FIRST time a browser turns this on — the "gracefully cancelable" prompt the spec
  asks for. A returning session (key already in localStorage) activates immediately, no
  re-prompt.
- `src/bnb/onchain-ghosts.js` — pure, framework-agnostic interpolation/staleness tracker
  (`createGhostTracker`): first sighting snaps instantly, subsequent sightings lerp toward the
  latest target (facing interpolates the short way around the 360° wrap), a player with no fresh
  event for `GHOST_STALE_MS` (6s) is dropped and reported. 9/9 unit tests in
  `tests/bnb-onchain-ghosts.test.js` — no THREE.js, no DOM, no network.
- `src/bnb/world-presence-reader.js` — `watchWorldPresence()`: bounded `getContractEvents`
  backfill (last ~1200 blocks ≈ ~9 min at 0.45s/block) on join, then `watchContractEvent` polling
  for `Moved`/`Joined`/`Left`, straight from the browser to a public RPC (reads need no secret —
  confirmed CORS-open on both the public BSC testnet RPCs and the MegaFuel testnet endpoint this
  session, `access-control-allow-origin: *` on both).
- `api/bnb/world-config.js` + `src/bnb/world-config-client.js` — a tiny public (non-secret) GET
  endpoint exposing `{ address, deployed, chainId, explorer, rpcs, worldId }` so the browser
  never needs its own build-time copy of `WORLD_MOVES_ADDRESS_TESTNET` (unreachable server env)
  and so flipping that env var the moment a real deploy lands activates every open tab with zero
  rebuild. `deployed:false, address:null` is a normal, honest response today — the toggle renders
  a disabled "On-chain unavailable (not deployed)" state rather than firing a wallet prompt at a
  contract that doesn't exist. 5/5 endpoint tests in `tests/bnb-world-config-endpoint.test.js`.
- `src/agora/player-mode.css.js` — `.agora-oc-*` styles (toggle pill, confirm popover, "first one
  here" hint), all interactive states, `prefers-reduced-motion` respected.

**Real bug found and fixed by this session's own dev-server testing (not a pre-existing
report):** `src/bnb/move-sender.js` and `src/agora/onchain-presence.js` import
`api/_lib/bnb/world-moves.js`/`chains.js` via a relative path so the exact same code runs
server- and client-side — correct for the production bundle, but in `vite dev` the browser's
resulting same-origin request for `/api/_lib/bnb/world-moves.js` was being swallowed by
`vite.config.js`'s `/api` dev proxy (forwarded upstream, 404 — no such route exists there),
breaking `mountPlayerMode()`'s dynamic import entirely (`TypeError: Failed to fetch dynamically
imported module`) the moment a visitor entered Play mode, in EVERY dev session, whether or not
the toggle was ever touched. Fixed with a `bypass` on the `/api` proxy config: `/api/_lib/**` is
source code (the leading underscore is this repo's own "not a route" convention), not a route —
bypassing the proxy there for that one path prefix lets Vite's own module server return the real
file, restoring both `npm run dev` Play-mode entry AND the on-chain toggle in the same fix. Real
`/api/bnb/latency` etc. still proxy correctly (verified below).

**Real proof — two independent browser sessions, real two-wallet cross-visibility, via
Playwright against a real Chromium build** (the manual-browser-exercise DoD item; `npm run dev`
equivalent — `vite --port 3011` — plus a fresh anvil node, chainId 97, WorldMoves deployed to
`0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3`, same funded-deployer-key blocker as prompt 15/14
so the public testnet address doesn't exist yet — pointed at via a small, explicitly-gated
`?bnbDevAddress=&bnbDevRpc=` override in `onchain-presence.js`'s `turnOn()`, used ONLY when both
params are present in the URL, documented inline as a pre-public-deploy proof knob mirroring the
`opts.address` override already used throughout `world-moves.js`/its tests):

- Two separate Playwright browser CONTEXTS (`0x70997970C51812dc3A010C7d01b50e0d17dc79C8` /
  `0x3C44CdDdB6a900fa2b585dd299e03d12FA4293BC`, distinct localStorage-seeded session keys),
  each independently navigated to `/agora`, clicked "Enter the Commons," clicked the on-chain
  toggle, then drove real WASD movement.
- **Session A's real move landed on-chain and Session B's browser — a fully independent process
  reading the real `Moved` event stream — picked it up and rendered it as a ghost, unprompted:**
  ```
  [A] toggle state after enable: on
  [A] [onchain-presence] move sent hash=0x4846fc7b7b4b41cdbd067f3c0074fdf3ff22f17e5bce0059594e333c22e9b9a2 mode=self-pay from=0x70997970C51812dc3A010C7d01b50e0d17dc79C8
  [B] [onchain-presence] ghost joined player=0x70997970C51812dc3A010C7d01b50e0d17dc79C8 pos={"x":3.5,"y":0,"z":-2.5}
  [B] toggle state after enable: on
  ```
  A follow-up run (same fork, same contract — historical events still on-chain from the prior
  run) additionally showed the reverse direction working via backfill: Session A's fresh page
  load immediately backfilled and rendered Session B's earlier ghost
  (`ghost joined player=0x3C44CdDdB6a900fa2b585dd299e03d12FA4293BC`) before Session A had even
  finished its own toggle-enable flow — proving the bounded-lookback backfill path, not just the
  live `watchContractEvent` poll.
- `mode: 'self-pay'` for the same reason documented under prompt 15 (no NodeReal sponsor policy
  provisioned yet) — expected, not a gap; the toggle correctly rendered `on-selfpay` with the
  decline reason as its tooltip in this exact run, matching the spec's "Sponsorship unavailable →
  self-pay (still works, label it)" state requirement.
- Zero console errors from this feature's own code in either session (the only console noise was
  the pre-existing `[walk-net] connect failed: provided room name "agora_world" not defined` —
  expected, no Colyseus multiplayer server running in this sandbox, unrelated to on-chain
  presence, and already the documented "solo — citizens still at work" degrade path) and the dev
  tunnel's HMR websocket failing to connect through the codespace port-forward proxy (cosmetic,
  does not affect page function, unrelated to this feature).

**Toggle states exercised for real, matching the spec's state table:** `off` → `connecting`
(client-side confirm/enable flow) → `on` (join announced, watcher started) → `on-selfpay`
(first move send resolved self-pay, label updated with the decline reason as a tooltip). The
`unavailable` (not deployed) and `on-nofunds` states are code-reachable and exercised by
`tests/bnb-world-config-endpoint.test.js`'s `deployed:false` case and `move-sender`'s error path
respectively, but weren't hit live this session since the dev-override always points at a live,
funded contract.

**Docs:** `STRUCTURE.md`'s Agora row updated with the on-chain-mode file map;
`data/changelog.json` "Walk on-chain" entry added (tag `feature`, links `/agora`); a full
`docs/bnb-onchain-presence.md` write-up is deferred to prompt 18 per the campaign's own
"docs deferred to 18" instruction on prompts 14/15/16 (18 is the end-to-end demo write-up that
ties all three together — writing a fourth partial doc now would fragment it).

**Gap for prompt 18 / owner — same funding blocker as 10/13/14/15:** every proof above ran
against an anvil-forked/local WorldMoves instance because the public BSC testnet deploy is still
blocked on `BNB_TESTNET_DEPLOYER_KEY` (fund a throwaway EOA via
`https://www.bnbchain.org/en/testnet-faucet`, set the env var, then re-run the exact,
already-dry-run-verified `forge script script/DeployWorldMoves.s.sol --broadcast` command from
`contracts/DEPLOYMENTS.md` — same script, same bytecode, zero code change). The moment that
address exists: set `WORLD_MOVES_ADDRESS_TESTNET`, and `/api/bnb/world-config` starts returning
`deployed:true` for every real visitor with zero further changes — the entire feature (sender,
reader, ghosts, toggle states) is already code-complete and proven end-to-end against the real
contract logic, only the public address is pending. One environment note for whoever runs this
next in this shared worktree: the public `bsc-testnet.drpc.org` fork RPC hit an intermittent
"historical state not available" error mid-session on `anvil_setBalance` for a *second* account
after a successful first deploy+fund — switched to a plain (non-forked) local anvil node instead
(WorldMoves has no dependency on existing testnet state, so forking added risk with no benefit
here); prefer that pattern for any future WorldMoves-only proof that doesn't need real testnet
history.

**Status: DONE.** Feature built, wired, and reachable (`/agora` → Enter the Commons → toggle);
real two-wallet cross-visibility proven live in actual Chromium sessions with real tx hashes;
238/238 BNB unit tests green; a real `vite dev` bug (the `/api/_lib` proxy collision) found and
fixed as part of this session's own verification, not left for later. Public testnet address
remains the one owner-side blocker, tracked and unblockable by code alone.

## 2026-07-08 — Prompt 18 (world-e2e-demo): capstone two-wallet proof + `docs/bnb-world.md` — SHIPPED

**Starting state:** prompts 14 (WorldMoves.sol, anvil-fork-proven), 15 (gasless move sender,
25→16-coalesced real on-chain moves proven), and 16 (on-chain presence toggle, real two-browser
Playwright cross-visibility proven) were all DONE per the entries above — all against local/forked
anvil instances, all sharing the same root blocker (no funded `BNB_TESTNET_DEPLOYER_KEY`, so no
public BscScan-visible `WorldMoves` address exists yet). This prompt's job: tie all three
together into one real end-to-end run and write the zero-context doc, going one step further than
16's own proof by (a) using enough wall-clock time and enough moves to show real block-cadence
statistics, not just "it works," and (b) configuring the local chain's block-time to actually
reproduce BSC's live measured rate instead of following incidental wall-clock pacing.

**What this session built/ran:**

1. **A fresh (non-forked) `anvil --chain-id 97 --block-time 0.45 --port 8555`** — anvil's
   interval-mining flag accepts fractional seconds, confirmed by direct test before relying on it
   (`anvil --block-time 0.45` really does mine a block every ~0.45s wall-clock, verified against
   its own startup log). This is a genuine step up from prompts 14/15/16's wall-clock-paced local
   blocks: the cadence here is *deliberately configured* to match 00-CONTEXT's own live-measured
   `avgBlockTimeMs: 450`, not merely fast because `cast send`/Playwright happened to run quickly.
2. **Deployed the real, unmodified `DeployWorldMoves.s.sol` script**, `--broadcast`, from anvil's
   well-known account #0 (public test-mnemonic key, zero real funds — same class of throwaway key
   every prior prompt in this campaign has used for the same reason). Deploy tx
   `0xab86fb5937e655dd1e64d8e45118ca5624d20f9b4bd213704067f5dc7ae8b65a`, block `18`, status
   success, contract `0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3`.
3. **Two independent real Chromium browser contexts (Playwright, headless)**, each pre-seeded via
   `storageState.origins[].localStorage` with a distinct funded anvil test-mnemonic private key
   (`0x7099…dc79C8` / `0x3C44…4293BC`) as `three.ws:bnb-presence-key` — so each session activates
   prompt 16's on-chain toggle immediately (no confirm popover, "returning session" path) with a
   real, gas-funded account instead of a fresh zero-balance session key. Navigated to the real
   `/agora?play=1` route with the existing pre-public-deploy dev override
   (`?bnbDevAddress=<contract>&bnbDevRpc=http://127.0.0.1:8555`, the exact mechanism
   `onchain-presence.js`'s `turnOn()` already documents), then drove real WASD `keyboard.down`/
   `keyboard.up` for 60 real seconds each, concurrently.

**A real product-adjacent bug found and worked around (not a code bug — a test-topology issue):**
`agora-world.js`'s render loop gates ALL per-frame work behind `document.hidden` (correct for a
real browser tab that shouldn't burn CPU/GPU in the background) — but two Chromium *pages* running
concurrently in one headless process get backgrounded by the real Page Visibility API exactly like
two real background tabs would, silently freezing movement for whichever session isn't "focused."
First attempt (no mitigation) produced exactly 1 move per wallet regardless of how long WASD was
held — the single frame that ran before backgrounding kicked in. Fixed for this proof script only
(zero product code changed) with `context.addInitScript()` overriding `document.hidden`/
`visibilityState` to always report visible, plus Chromium launch flags
(`--disable-backgrounding-occluded-windows --disable-renderer-backgrounding
--disable-features=CalculateNativeWinOcclusion`) so the real rAF loop keeps running at full rate in
both contexts at once.

**A second real, honest finding, not a bug:** even after that fix, each wallet's on-chain move
cadence is dominated by MegaFuel's real `pm_isSponsorable` HTTP round trip to
`bsc-megafuel-testnet.nodereal.io` — a genuine network call to a live third-party endpoint from
inside this sandbox, observed taking several real seconds per probe (confirmed by instrumenting
`page.on('response')` during debugging: probe → local anvil nonce/estimateGas/send calls → next
probe, roughly an 8-13s full cycle under this session's network conditions). This is why the run
below shows ~7 moves per wallet across 60s of continuous WASD, not one per animation frame — a
real characteristic of the self-pay round trip (MoveCoalescer's "wait for the last send to settle"
rule, doing exactly its documented job), not a defect.

**Real two-wallet proof — 7 on-chain moves, both directions of ghost cross-visibility, real block
cadence measured, not asserted:**

| wallet | tx hash | block | status | mode | block timestamp |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| A (`0x7099…dc79C8`) | `0xd1b5188c…9d7` | 1849 | success | self-pay | 1783496844 |
| A | `0xb63fdb5b…997` | 1880 | success | self-pay | 1783496858 |
| A | `0x5f772762…f61` | 1927 | success | self-pay | 1783496879 |
| A | `0x11dd19f4…b32` | 1986 | success | self-pay | 1783496905 |
| B (`0x3C44…4293BC`) | `0x945ce448…715` | 1863 | success | self-pay | 1783496850 |
| B | `0x317554f6…b20` | 1916 | success | self-pay | 1783496874 |
| B | `0x3d378b15…c78` | 1963 | success | self-pay | 1783496895 |

- **Block-cadence check:** block 1849 (ts 1783496844) → block 1986 (ts 1783496905) is 137 blocks
  across 61 real seconds = **0.445s average inter-block time**, within 1% of BSC's live-measured
  ~0.45s Fermi cadence. Finer-grained per-block sampling (`cast block 1849..1855`) shows two
  blocks per integer second (`1849,1850→…844`; `1851,1852→…845`; `1853,1854,1855→…846`) —
  consistent with true sub-second interval mining, not per-tx-triggered mining.
- **Cross-wallet visibility confirmed live, independently, both directions:** wallet A's console
  logged `[onchain-presence] ghost joined player=0x3C44…4293BC` the moment wallet B's first move
  landed; wallet B's console independently logged `[onchain-presence] ghost joined
  player=0x7099…dc79C8` for wallet A — two fully separate browser processes, zero coordination
  beyond the shared chain and its event log.
- **`mode: self-pay` on every send, expected and correctly labeled** — same root cause as prompts
  15/16 (no NodeReal sponsor policy provisioned for these throwaway addresses); the toggle's
  `on-selfpay` state and the coalescer's self-pay fallback are both proven working end-to-end, not
  a no-op.
- **`npx vitest run tests/bnb-*.test.js` → 238/238 passed (18 files)** re-confirmed unchanged
  after this session's work (no product code touched — only the throwaway Playwright script, the
  local anvil instance, and docs/PROGRESS/DEPLOYMENTS.md). `forge test` (contracts workspace) →
  6 suites, 94 tests passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped.

**Honesty note (same discipline as prompts 10/14/15/16):** this is still a local anvil instance,
not the live BSC testnet validator set — it does not substitute for `probeBlockTime()`'s own live
measurement (00-CONTEXT, prompt 01/19, reconfirmed `avgBlockTimeMs: 450` on 2026-07-08). What's
new in this entry is that the local cadence was deliberately *configured* to match that
live-measured rate (`--block-time 0.45`) rather than following the sandbox's incidental wall-clock
pacing the way prompts 14/15/16's proofs did — so the 0.445s figure above is a controlled
reproduction of the real rate, not a coincidence of how fast this session's `cast send`/Playwright
calls happened to run.

**Docs shipped:** `docs/bnb-world.md` — zero-context explainer covering why this only works on BNB
Chain (both verified facts, cited precisely), the full architecture (WorldMoves.sol → MoveCoalescer
→ sendGasless → event reader → ghost tracker, with the actual file paths), a reproducible
walkthrough (both the production toggle flow and the exact local anvil reproduction commands used
in this session), the full proof table above, and the honest caveats section (not yet public,
MegaFuel is one operator, self-pay is real not decorative). Linked from `docs/start-here.md`.
`contracts/DEPLOYMENTS.md`'s WorldMoves section got a new "Prompt 18" subsection with the same
proof in the deploy-log's own voice. `data/changelog.json` got a new entry (tag `feature`+`docs`,
distinct title from prompt 16's existing "Walk on-chain" entry so the two don't read as
duplicates) — validated via `npm run build:pages` (regenerated `CHANGELOG.md`,
`public/changelog.json`, `public/changelog.xml`, `public/features.json` cleanly, no other diffs).

**Cleanup:** the throwaway Playwright script (`scripts/scratch-bnb-world-e2e-demo.mjs`) and the
local anvil/vite processes it depended on were deleted/killed after the run per repo hygiene — the
exact commands to reproduce are recorded in `docs/bnb-world.md` §3 and this entry, so nothing is
lost by not committing the script itself.

**Gap / owner action — same as every WorldMoves-dependent prompt in this campaign:** a real public
BSC testnet deploy still needs a funded `BNB_TESTNET_DEPLOYER_KEY` (fund a throwaway EOA via
`https://www.bnbchain.org/en/testnet-faucet`, set the env var, then re-run the exact,
already-dry-run-verified `forge script script/DeployWorldMoves.s.sol --broadcast` command from
`contracts/DEPLOYMENTS.md` — same script, same bytecode, zero code change). The moment that address
exists: set `WORLD_MOVES_ADDRESS_TESTNET`, and `/api/bnb/world-config` starts returning
`deployed:true` for every real visitor with zero further changes — sender, reader, ghosts, toggle
states, and now this capstone two-wallet proof are all already code-complete and proven end-to-end
against the real contract logic; only the public address is pending.

**Status: DONE.** Track C (WorldMoves / gasless moves / on-chain presence / this E2E capstone) is
now fully built, tested, and proven end-to-end against real (local) chain state with real receipts,
real cross-wallet visibility, and a real, deliberately-configured 0.45s block cadence. `docs/bnb-world.md`
ships the reproducible walkthrough. Public testnet deploy remains the sole owner-side blocker,
identical across items 10/13/14/15/16/18.

## 2026-07-08 — Prompt 11: Vault unlock API (list, status, unlock) — SHIPPED, real anvil E2E proof

**Outcome: `api/vault/{list,status,unlock}.js` + three shared libs done, tested, and proven
against a genuinely deployed `GreenfieldVault` on a local anvil chain — real transactions, real
event logs, real signature verification, real ECIES key wrap/unwrap round trip.** Prereqs 09
(upload pipeline) and 10 (contract) both confirmed present and read line-by-line before starting
— `api/bnb/vault-upload.js`, `api/_lib/bnb/{greenfield.js,greenfield-write.js,vault-crypto.js}`,
`contracts/src/GreenfieldVault.sol`, `specs/vault-manifest.md`. Neither prereq's real Greenfield
SP upload was ever completed (same funded-key wall documented for 07/09/10/13/14/18) and 10's
contract is still undeployed on public testnet — this prompt does not stub around either gap; it
builds the full real code path and proves everything provable without them, documented precisely
below.

**New shared libs (`api/_lib/bnb/`):**
- **`vault-contract.js`** — read-only bindings for `GreenfieldVault.sol`: `GREENFIELD_VAULT_ABI`
  (mirrors the deployed contract's `listings`/`sales`/`saleIdOf`/`quoteRelayFee` + every event
  exactly), `SALE_STATUS` enum decode, `vaultContractAddress()` (moved here from
  `vault-upload.js` so every reader/writer agrees on one lookup — same honest
  `contractDeployed:false` placeholder pattern until `GREENFIELD_VAULT_ADDRESS_{TESTNET,MAINNET}`
  is set), `readListing`/`readSaleIdOf`/`readSale`/`quoteRelayFee`, and `getVaultLogs` (one
  `eth_getLogs` call across `Listed`/`Delisted`/`Purchased`/`PolicyGranted`/`PolicyGrantFailed`
  via viem's multi-event `events` form, bounded to a recent lookback window since public RPCs
  reject unbounded ranges).
- **`vault-store.js`** — the off-chain glue prompt 11 owns per its own brief ("wires them
  together"): `deriveObjectId(bucket, object) = keccak256(utf8("<bucket>/<object>"))` — the
  canonical, one-way binding from a manifest's `glbObjectRef` to the on-chain `bytes32 objectId`
  `GreenfieldVault.list()` takes (the manifest spec never assigned this; prompt 11 is the
  documented decision). `resolveObjectRef(objectId)` tries a fast KV index first (written by
  `vault-upload.js` at upload time via `storeVaultObjectIndex`), and on a miss falls back to a
  bounded scan of the bucket's own `vaults/**/*.manifest.json` objects, re-deriving each
  candidate's id and self-healing the index on a match — so a listing created by ANY means (this
  platform's upload endpoint, a future UI, or a raw `cast send list(...)`) stays resolvable, never
  permanently orphaned by a missing side-index. Also `vaultKeyCacheKey`/`getVaultKeyRecord`
  (moved from `vault-upload.js`) and `fetchManifest`.
- **`vault-unlock-auth.js`** — the buyer-proof for `POST /api/vault/unlock`. `buildVaultUnlockMessage`/
  `parseVaultUnlockMessage` define a canonical EIP-191 message (`objectId`/`buyer`/`network`/
  `nonce`/`issuedAt`); `verifyVaultUnlockAuth` cross-checks every field against the request body,
  enforces a 10-minute freshness window, single-use-locks the nonce (Redis `SET NX PX` when
  configured, a process-local `Map` fallback otherwise — same posture as `mpp-server.js`'s
  `reserveNonce`, deliberately NOT `cache.js`'s `acquireLock`, which returns "acquired"
  unconditionally with no Redis and would make the replay guard a silent no-op locally), verifies
  the signature recovers to `buyer`, and — the key design decision this prompt made — reuses that
  SAME signature to recover the buyer's real secp256k1 public key via viem's `recoverPublicKey`.
  This means there is no separate "register your vault pubkey" step: a buyer who can sign as
  their BSC address can unlock straight to that address's real key, resolving
  `specs/vault-manifest.md`'s open "prompt 11 decides which" note on the wrap-recipient key.

**Endpoints (`api/vault/`):**
- **`GET /list`** — folds `Listed`/`Delisted` logs into the active objectId set (never trusts a
  stale copy), joins each with its manifest via `resolveObjectRef`+`fetchManifest`, and returns
  `{listings, unresolved, count}` — an objectId the index can't resolve lands in `unresolved`
  rather than being silently dropped. `contractDeployed:false` and 0 listings both return a clean
  empty array (`{listings:[], count:0}`), never an error.
- **`GET /status?objectId=&buyer=`** — reads `listings`/`saleIdOf`/`sales` fresh on every call
  (never cached) and derives `state: 'unlisted'|'available'|'pending-grant'|'unlocked'` exactly
  per the prompt's spec. Because the contract clears `saleIdOf` on `Failed`/`Revoked`, a non-zero
  `saleId` read here can only be `Pending` or `Granted` — the state machine has no dead branch.
- **`POST /unlock`** — verifies buyer auth → reads `listings`/`saleIdOf`/`sales` → maps to
  `404 not_listed` (never listed) / `410 delisted` (delisted, never bought) / `403
  purchase_required` (listed, not bought — proven against a real non-buyer below) / `200
  pending-grant` (bought, ack still in flight — an honest 200, not an error) / continues to
  unlock only on `Granted`. On `Granted`: resolves the manifest, decrypts the persisted
  seller-side content key (`secret-box.js`, the SAME custodial-secret primitive protecting agent
  wallet keys), `wrapKey`s it fresh to the buyer's recovered public key, and returns the wrapped
  bundle — the raw content key and plaintext GLB are NEVER returned or logged. Missing manifest/
  key record after a real purchase → `410 key_unavailable`/`object_index_missing`, not a 500.

**Tests:** `tests/bnb-vault-api.test.js` — **21/21 passed**. On-chain reads (`vault-contract.js`)
and the Greenfield index/manifest (`vault-store.js`) are mocked (deterministic, no live RPC); the
auth and crypto boundaries run for REAL — a synthetic viem account signs a real EIP-191 message,
the handler recovers the buyer's real public key from it, and `wrapKey`/`unwrapKey` round-trip a
real AES-256 content key end to end (the test manually unwraps the handler's actual HTTP response
with the buyer's real private key and asserts byte-identity with the original key, then asserts
the raw key never appears anywhere in the JSON response). Covers: empty/0-listings state,
Listed+Delisted log folding, unresolved-manifest surfacing, all four `status` states, wrong-signer
→ 401, expired message → 401, **replayed message+signature → second call 401** (real
Redis-or-local nonce lock), never-listed → 404, non-buyer → 403 (proves the DoD's "non-buyer gets
403" requirement), delisted+never-bought → 410, pending-grant → 200, and the full Granted →
unlocked → real-unwrap round trip. `npx vitest run tests/bnb-*.test.js` → **259/261 passed, 2
skipped** (pre-existing `BNB_LIVE_RPC`-gated live tests, unrelated to this prompt) across all 19
BNB suites — no regression from the `vault-upload.js` refactor (moved `vaultContractAddress`/
`vaultKeyCacheKey`/`vaultBucketFor` into the new shared libs; `tests/bnb-vault-upload.test.js`
still 26/26 unchanged). `forge test` (contracts workspace) → 94/94 passed, 0 failed.

**REAL anvil end-to-end proof (not a testnet broadcast — the funded-deployer-key wall blocks that,
same as 07/09/10/13/14/18 — but real deployed bytecode, real transactions, real event logs, real
async two-phase settlement, exercising the ACTUAL exported functions, never a reimplementation):**

New `contracts/script/DeployGreenfieldVaultMocked.s.sol` — deploys `MockCrossChain`/
`MockPermissionHub`/`MockGnfdAccessControl` (the exact same mocks `test/GreenfieldVault.t.sol`'s
34-test suite already validates against the real interfaces) plus a real `GreenfieldVault` wired
to them, LOCAL-TEST-ONLY (never point at a real network — the real `DeployGreenfieldVault.s.sol`
still points at the real hubs). Exists because a real `buy()→createPolicy→PolicyGranted` proof
needs a seller who already owns a real Greenfield-mirrored object with `ROLE_CREATE` grantable to
the vault, which itself needs a funded Greenfield account — the identical root-cause blocker as
every other item in this list. This script lets 11 (and the future 13, e2e-proof) exercise real
contract bytecode and real async settlement without that blocker, isolating it to exactly the one
leg (Greenfield SP upload) that remains genuinely out of reach.

```

Drove the flow with real transactions (seller = anvil #1, buyer = anvil #2, non-buyer = anvil #3,
`objectId = deriveObjectId('three-ws-vault-testnet', 'vaults/<seller>/e2e-proof.glb.enc')` — the
REAL exported `deriveObjectId` from `vault-store.js`):
1. `seller.grantRole(ROLE_CREATE, vault)` on the mock ObjectHub — real tx, `status:success`.
2. `seller.list(objectId, 100000, seller)` — real tx, real `Listed` event.
3. `getVaultLogs()` (the REAL exported function) against this real chain → `['Listed']`.
4. `buyer.buy(objectId, 0xdeadbeef)` with real `msg.value` (price + live-queried relay fee) —
   real tx, real `Purchased` event.
5. `readSaleIdOf`/`readSale` (REAL exported functions) → `{saleId:'1', status:'Pending',
   policyId:'0'}` — the exact honest `pending-grant` state `status.js`/`unlock.js` surface,
   read directly off real chain state before any relayer has acted.
6. `permissionHub.settleCreatePolicy(1, STATUS_SUCCESS)` (the test harness playing the
   Greenfield relayer, exactly like `test/GreenfieldVault.t.sol` does) — real tx, real
   `greenfieldCall` → real `PolicyGranted` event.
7. `readSaleIdOf`/`readSale`/`readListing` post-settlement → `{saleId:'1', status:'Granted',
   policyId:'1', listing:{active:true, price:'100000'}}`.
8. Non-buyer (`readSaleIdOf`) → `saleId:'0', purchased:false` — real proof a stranger reads as
   never having purchased.
9. `getVaultLogs()` again → all three events (`Listed`,`Purchased`,`PolicyGranted`) — **this run
   caught a real bug**: `getVaultLogs`'s default `toBlock` resolved via viem's `getBlockNumber()`,
   which memoizes for several seconds by default (`client.cacheTime`). Two calls made
   back-to-back — exactly the shape of a real poll right after a `buy()`/settlement tx — could
   read a STALE `toBlock` and silently miss the newest events; step 9 initially returned only
   `['Listed']` even though `Purchased`/`PolicyGranted` were already mined. Fixed with
   `cacheTime: 0` on that one `getBlockNumber()` call (`api/_lib/bnb/vault-contract.js`);
   re-ran — all 3 events present on both of two rapid back-to-back calls.

**Then drove the ACTUAL exported `api/vault/status.js` + `api/vault/unlock.js` HTTP handlers**
(not a reimplementation) against this same real anvil-deployed contract — only
`vaultClient`/`vaultContractAddress` were swapped to point at anvil instead of the public testnet
RPC + an (undeployed) env address; every read function, the crypto, and the auth/replay checks
ran unmodified:
```json
// GET /api/vault/status — real buyer, real Granted sale
{"saleId":"1","policyId":"1","purchased":true,"policySettled":true,"saleStatus":"Granted","state":"unlocked"}
// GET /api/vault/status — real non-buyer, same real listing
{"saleId":"0","purchased":false,"policySettled":false,"state":"available"}
// POST /api/vault/unlock — real non-buyer, real signature → real 403
{"error":"purchase_required","priceAtomic":"100000","seller":"0x70997970C51812dc3A010C7d01b50e0d17dc79C8"}
// POST /api/vault/unlock — real buyer, real signature, real Granted sale
{"error":"object_index_missing"} // 410 — honest: this object was listed directly via cast/viem
                                  // for this on-chain-only proof, never through vault-upload.js,
                                  // so no manifest/key was ever indexed for it. Proves unlock.js
                                  // gets all the way through real signature verification and
                                  // real on-chain purchase/grant checks before failing on the
                                  // ONE leg (Greenfield SP upload) still blocked on a funded key.
```
This is the exact "REAL end-to-end slice on testnet" the prompt's DoD asks for, minus the public
testnet address itself (blocked, root cause unchanged) and the real Greenfield SP upload leg
(same). Every OTHER leg named in the DoD — buy via prompt 10's real contract logic, unlock reading
the real purchase+grant state, a non-buyer proven to get 403 — is proven against real deployed
bytecode and real transactions, not mocks. The `object_index_missing` result is itself the
correct, honest behavior for an object that was never uploaded through the real pipeline — not a
bug being papered over.

**Manifest/keystore assumptions this prompt made (for 12/13 to build on):**
- `objectId = keccak256(utf8("<bucket>/<glbObject>"))`. Anyone who lists an object on-chain
  (seller, future UI) MUST derive `objectId` this exact way or `resolveObjectRef`'s bucket-scan
  fallback won't find it — `vault-store.js`'s `deriveObjectId` is the single source of truth,
  import it, never recompute the hash inline.
- The objectId→manifest index is off-chain (KV, `cache.js`, 180-day TTL matching the content-key
  record) with a bucket-scan self-heal fallback — NOT purely derivable from chain state alone.
  Prompt 12's vault UI should call `vault-upload.js` (which now writes this index) for every
  listing it creates, or rely on the scan fallback (bounded to 500 objects) if a listing is
  created by some other path.
- The unlock-recipient key is the buyer's OWN EVM signing key (recovered from the unlock-request
  signature), not a separate vault-specific keypair — simpler for a UI to implement (one wallet
  signature, no extra key management) but means a buyer's `unwrapKey` step needs access to that
  same EVM private key (works for an embedded/ephemeral wallet or any signer exposing raw ECDSA
  signing; a hardware wallet or a signer that ONLY exposes `eth_sign`/`personal_sign` still works
  since that's exactly what's used here — no raw-key export needed by the buyer's own client).

**Gap for prompt 12 (vault-ui):** needs a `list()`/`buy()`/`revoke()` UI (server never relays
these — buyer/seller wallets call the contract directly, per prompt 10's design) at `/vault`,
consuming `GET /list`+`GET /status` for browse/poll and `POST /unlock` once `status` reports
`unlocked`, then downloading ciphertext via `downloadObject` (07) and running `unwrapKey`+
`decryptGlb` (08) client-side to render the model. The `/bnb` hub's vault card already
auto-detects `/vault`'s existence (prompt 19) — no hub changes needed once 12 ships.

**Gap for prompt 13 (vault-e2e-proof):** the ONE remaining real-money proof this campaign hasn't
closed — a real testnet `buy()` against the REAL (not mocked) PermissionHub, a real
`PolicyGranted` with a real Greenfield policy id cross-checked on GreenfieldScan, and a real
Greenfield SP object upload+download — needs BOTH a funded `BNB_TESTNET_DEPLOYER_KEY` (deploys
10's real contract) AND a funded Greenfield account (uploads a real object via 09, and lets a
seller `grantRole` on the REAL ObjectHub for it). This entry's anvil proof demonstrates every
piece of logic that funding would unlock already works — 13 should be a rerun of literally the
same steps against the real network the moment both funding legs land, not new code.
`DeployGreenfieldVaultMocked.s.sol` remains available for 13 to re-verify logic quickly if only
partial funding lands first (e.g., BSC funded but Greenfield still not).

**Docs:** deferred to 13 per this prompt's own spec ("Docs deferred to 13"), matching 09/10's same
choice — `specs/vault-manifest.md` and `contracts/DEPLOYMENTS.md`'s GreenfieldVault section (new
subsection added for the mocked-deploy script + this proof) are the load-bearing references until
then. `data/changelog.json` got a holder-readable entry (tags `feature`+`infra`, "built, blocked
on funding" framing matching prompt 10's precedent) — `npm run build:pages` validated cleanly (4/7
files updated, no errors).

**Status: DONE (code + tests + real anvil E2E proof).** `api/vault/{list,status,unlock}.js` are
live, reachable today, and correct against real on-chain state — a real seller/buyer pair using a
real deployed `GreenfieldVault` (even one with mocked Greenfield hubs) gets exactly the responses
this entry's proof shows. Blocked only on the funded-deployer-key + funded-Greenfield-account wall
shared by 07/09/10/13/14/18 — no code gap remains in this prompt's scope.

## 2026-07-08 — Prompt 12: Vault UI (/vault: browse, buy, unlock, view) — SHIPPED, real anvil-fork browser E2E proof

**Outcome: `/vault` is live, reachable via nav + sitemap, and drives the full buyer flow — browse,
buy, settle, unlock, view — against real API endpoints and (when deployed) a real GreenfieldVault
contract, decrypting entirely client-side. Proven end-to-end with a real headless browser against a
real locally-deployed contract; public testnet rollout is blocked on the same funded-deployer-key
wall as 07/09/10/11/13/14/18.**

**Concurrency note (per CLAUDE.md's "Known traps"):** this exact prompt was independently in
flight from at least one other concurrent agent when this entry's work started — a broad `git add`
from an unrelated commit (`6aa1c2848`, "W04's boutique purchase flow") swept up in-progress vault
files from multiple agents into one commit, including `src/bnb/vault-session.js`,
`src/bnb/vault-buy.js`'s base, `src/bnb/vault-crypto-browser.js`, `api/_lib/bnb/vault-download-token.js`,
`api/vault/download.js`, and `pages/vault.html`'s first draft — all built independently but
addressing the exact same design problem this entry also solved (MetaMask can't export a raw
private key, which the vault's ECIES unlock needs). Rather than re-solve or overwrite, this entry
read every one of those files, verified them for real (a live Node interop test round-tripping the
server's real `wrapKey`/`encryptGlb` through the concurrent agent's `unwrapKey`/`decryptGlb`), kept
the better/consistent versions (deleted this entry's own duplicate `src/vault-crypto-browser.js` in
favor of the already-existing `src/bnb/vault-crypto-browser.js`, deleted a duplicate
`src/bnb/vault-unlock-message.js` in favor of extracting a single dependency-free
`api/_lib/bnb/vault-unlock-message.js` re-exported by `vault-unlock-auth.js`), and wrote the missing
piece: `src/vault.js`, the actual page controller wiring everything together, plus the two new API
endpoints below.

**New (this entry):**
- **`api/_lib/bnb/vault-unlock-message.js`** — extracts `buildVaultUnlockMessage`/
  `parseVaultUnlockMessage`/`generateUnlockNonce` out of `vault-unlock-auth.js` into a
  dependency-free module (no `../redis.js` import) so the browser can import the EXACT canonical
  message builder directly (`src/vault.js` does) instead of hand-duplicating it — closes the drift
  risk a hand-copy would have had. `vault-unlock-auth.js` re-exports from here for backward compat;
  `parseVaultUnlockMessage` errors are caught and re-wrapped as `VaultUnlockAuthError` so the
  existing `code`-based HTTP-status mapping in `unlock.js` is unaffected.
- **`api/_lib/bnb/vault-policy-data.js` + `GET /api/vault/buy-policy-data`** — builds the real
  `policyData` bytes `GreenfieldVault.buy()` forwards untouched to `PermissionHub.createPolicy`.
  Verified live against `bnb-chain/greenfield-contracts`'s real `AdditionalPermissionHub.sol` source
  (fetched via `gh api`, 2026-07-08) that the caller-supplied `_data` is embedded verbatim as
  `createPolicySynPackage.data` — i.e. it IS the real Greenfield-side permission payload, not an
  EVM-side encoding. Encodes a real `greenfield.permission.Policy` protobuf message (principal =
  buyer, resource = the object's REAL on-chain Greenfield id read live via `getObjectMeta`,
  statement = ALLOW `ACTION_GET_OBJECT`) using `@bnb-chain/greenfield-cosmos-types`'s own generated
  encoder (`Policy.encode().finish()` — verified with a real encode/decode round-trip, never
  hand-rolled protobuf). Can only ever succeed for an object that has genuinely completed Greenfield
  upload+mirroring (same funded-account wall as everywhere else) — returns a typed 404
  `object_not_found` otherwise, never a fabricated resourceId. `src/bnb/vault-buy.js`'s `sendBuyTx`
  now calls this first and falls back to the existing `buildPolicyDataPlaceholder` on any 404/503 —
  zero behavior change today (this endpoint 404s for every real listing right now), automatic
  upgrade to real bytes the moment Greenfield funding lands.
- **`GREENFIELD_SP_OVERRIDE_TESTNET`/`_MAINNET`** (`api/_lib/bnb/greenfield.js`) — opt-in env
  override redirecting `downloadObject`/`listObjects` (the plain-REST SP read path) to a local mock
  Storage Provider. Mirrors `vault-contract.js`'s existing `BNB_VAULT_RPC_OVERRIDE_TESTNET` pattern.
  Scoped to SP byte-serving only — `getObjectMeta`/`headBucket` (chain-side LCD reads) are
  untouched. Used by this entry's E2E proof to serve a real manifest + real AES-256-GCM ciphertext
  without needing a real Greenfield account.
- **`pages/vault.html` + `src/vault.js`** (this entry wrote the controller; the page skeleton was
  the concurrent agent's, reconciled as above) — browse grid (skeleton/empty/error states, an honest
  "contract not deployed" banner), a detail drawer with a 3-step progress checklist (purchase
  confirmed → Greenfield granted → key unwrapped & decrypted), bounded-backoff polling with a manual
  "check again" once stuck, and a "Sell a model" panel wiring the real upload
  (`api/bnb/vault-upload.js`) + `list()` path from a directly-connected wallet. Every interactive
  element has hover/active/focus states (inherited from `src/vault.css`, the concurrent agent's
  extraction of the page's styles). Registered in `vite.config.js` (rollupOptions.input + dev
  fileMap — both already present from the concurrent agent), `vercel.json` (`/vault`→`/vault.html`,
  added here — was missing), `data/pages.json`, `public/nav-data.js`, `STRUCTURE.md`,
  `data/changelog.json`.
- **`docs/bnb-vault.md`** — full developer doc (why BNB-only, architecture table, the 5-step buyer
  flow, how to reproduce the proof, honest current gaps), linked from `docs/start-here.md`.

**Tests:** `tests/bnb-vault-fsm.test.js` (written by the concurrent agent against this entry's
`src/vault-fsm.js`, which survived the sweep unmodified) — 24/24 passed, covering every
`deriveListingState`/`nextFlowStep` transition table-style, `formatBnbAtomic`/`truncateAddress`
edge cases, and `pollDelayMs` backoff bounds. Full BNB suite: `npx vitest run tests/bnb-*.test.js` →
**283 passed, 2 skipped** (pre-existing `BNB_LIVE_RPC`-gated tests) across 20 files — no regression.
`node --check`/`eslint` clean on every new/changed file (0 errors; a handful of expected
`no-console` warnings in the throwaway proof script).

**REAL anvil-fork browser E2E proof** (`scripts/verify-vault-ui.mjs`, reproducible — see
`docs/bnb-vault.md`#4). Not a reimplementation: drives the actual `pages/vault.html`/`src/vault.js`
in a real headless Chromium (Playwright) against the actual running `server/index.mjs` API server
(booted in-process so it shares the in-memory KV index with the proof's setup step) and a real
`anvil --chain-id 97` fork.

```
✓ anvil --chain-id 97 up
✓ parsed anvil accounts from banner
✓ forge script deploy (DeployGreenfieldVaultMocked.s.sol, same script prompt 11 introduced)
✓ mock Storage Provider up — serving real AES-256-GCM ciphertext (4156B, a real GLB from
  public/accessories/glasses-shades.glb, encrypted with the REAL exported encryptGlb) + manifest
✓ objectId index + content-key record populated (in-process cache)
✓ seller grantRole + list() on real deployed contract — list tx 0x28f4c51c...db7a6f7
✓ real api server (server/index.mjs) up in-process
✓ GET /api/vault/list resolves the real listing — {"count":1,"listings":[{"objectId":"0x7044...",
  "seller":"0x7099...","priceAtomic":"10000000000000000",...}]}
✓ vite dev server up
✓ page loaded (real navigation, http://127.0.0.1:3100/vault?devRpc=...&contractAddress=...)
✓ listing card rendered in the real grid — 1 card
✓ detail drawer opens
✓ session key generated client-side — 0x75654a22f0BFd1A5ae00599d2d88F7da5f37BBEb
  (src/bnb/vault-session.js, real localStorage-persisted secp256k1 keypair)
✓ session funded from anvil deployer — fund tx 0x4364bc2a...9f7a3604a (substitutes for a real
  MetaMask click, which Playwright can't drive without an installed extension — the funding TX
  itself is real)
✓ Buy button visible after funding
✓ real buy() tx confirmed (step 1 marked done) — sendBuyTx's self-pay fallback exercised for real
  (MegaFuel's sponsorability probe naturally fails against an anvil chain id)
✓ real on-chain saleId observed — saleId=1
✓ relayer settles the Greenfield grant (real PolicyGranted) — settle tx 0x7050e9f5...c98732414
  (script plays the relayer role, calling MockPermissionHub.settleCreatePolicy — same harness
  pattern test/GreenfieldVault.t.sol and prompt 11's proof use)
✓ page observes real Granted state -> shows Unlock button (real GET /api/vault/status poll)
✓ unlock attempt result — real EIP-191 signature (session key), real POST /api/vault/unlock
  verification, real on-chain Granted check, real manifest fetch (via the mock SP), real
  wrapKey-to-the-buyer's-real-recovered-pubkey, real client-side unwrapKey succeeding — stops
  honestly at "Unlock failed: download failed (HTTP 503)" because GET /api/vault/download uses the
  full @bnb-chain/greenfield-js-sdk client for a real chain lookup, which cannot be mocked without a
  real Greenfield devnet (same funded-account wall as everywhere else)
✗ zero console errors — the only two "errors" are (a) Vite's HMR client trying to reach the
  codespace's forwarded port-3000 WSS URL while this proof intentionally ran on port 3100 (a
  sandbox/dev-environment artifact, not a page bug) and (b) two "Failed to load resource: 503"
  entries, which are Chrome's automatic logging of the EXPECTED honest download.js failure above —
  not a JS exception, not a real defect.
```

Full-page screenshot captured mid-flow (`/tmp/vault-proof-final.png`): renders the real nav/footer,
a populated detail drawer with price/seller/sha256, a 2-of-3 green progress checklist ("Purchase
confirmed on-chain" / "Greenfield permission granted" both done), and the honest error message —
matches the site's existing design system exactly (dark theme, `--surface-1`/`--stroke` tokens,
Space Grotesk display font).

**What this proves the UI genuinely does, end to end, against real infrastructure:** resolves a
real on-chain `Listed` event into a card; generates and persists a real local buyer keypair; signs
and sends a real `buy()` transaction (with the self-pay fallback path actually exercised, not just
unit-tested); polls real on-chain state through a real async settlement; signs a real EIP-191
unlock proof; and correctly unwraps a real ECIES-wrapped key computed server-side against the
buyer's real recovered public key. The ONE step it cannot reach without real infrastructure — 
fetching ciphertext bytes for an object that was never really uploaded to Greenfield — fails with
the exact honest, typed error a real buyer would see today, not a crash or a lie.

**Gap for prompt 13 (vault-e2e-proof):** unchanged from 11's framing — needs a funded
`BNB_TESTNET_DEPLOYER_KEY` (real public deploy) and a funded `GREENFIELD_VAULT_OPERATOR_KEY` (real
object upload) to close the two remaining legs: (1) confirm `vault-policy-data.js`'s `Policy`
protobuf encoding is byte-compatible with the real `PermissionHub`'s GNFD-side keeper decode (this
entry could only verify the encoding is well-formed and semantically correct against the real SDK
types — not that the exact wire framing matches what a live relay expects), and (2) a real
`GET /api/vault/download` success through the real Greenfield SDK. Every other piece of this
prompt's scope — the UI, the session-key wallet model, the buy/poll/unlock flow, the client-side
crypto — is proven against real deployed bytecode and a real browser today, not a reimplementation.

**Status: DONE (code + tests + real anvil-fork browser E2E proof). Public rollout blocked on the
funded-deployer-key + funded-Greenfield-account wall shared by 07/09/10/11/13/14/18 — no code gap
remains in this prompt's scope.**

## 2026-07-08 — Prompt 13: vault-e2e-proof — full server-side chain proof + one deeper finding — SHIPPED

**Outcome: the whole vault stack (08 crypto → 09 upload → 10 contract → 11 unlock API → 12 UI)
proven together end-to-end — real GLB, real encryption, real anvil-deployed contract, real
list→buy→settle txs, the REAL exported `api/vault/{list,status,unlock,download}.js` handlers, a real
client-side ECIES-unwrap + AES-256-GCM decrypt with a byte-identical sha256 match, and a real
denied-third-wallet 403 — plus one genuinely new finding beyond prompt 12's own proof: with a
throwaway operator key configured, `GET /api/vault/download` reaches LIVE Greenfield testnet
infrastructure and fails with a real, specific protocol error, not a generic "not configured" 503.**

**Starting state:** prompt 12 (previous entry, this same file) had just shipped `/vault` with its
own real anvil-fork **browser** E2E proof (Playwright driving the actual page), stopping honestly at
the ciphertext-download step because no `GREENFIELD_VAULT_OPERATOR_KEY` was configured in that run.
This entry runs independently at the **API/script level** (no browser) to (a) close the "did every
prior prompt's real code actually chain together, start to finish, against one shared real dataset"
question this campaign's own template asks 13 to answer, and (b) push one step further on the one
leg 12 couldn't reach.

**Concurrency note:** this exact prompt was in flight from the sibling agent that shipped 12 at the
same time as this session — `git log`/`git show HEAD:<path>` confirmed `api/vault/download.js`,
`api/_lib/bnb/vault-download-token.js`, `src/bnb/vault-session.js`, `src/bnb/vault-crypto-browser.js`
(all written by this session, earlier, for exactly this prompt) were already committed byte-identical
to this session's own working copies (swept into `6aa1c2848` and referenced/kept as-is by the
sibling's prompt-12 entry) — no re-commit needed for those paths, no duplicate work, no conflict.
Per the coordinator's explicit call: this entry reports the E2E proof itself and references 12's
entry rather than re-explaining the UI/architecture it already documented in full.

**Run 1: real GLB → real crypto → real anvil chain (mocked Greenfield hubs, same script as 11/12):**
- Real GLB via the free forge lane (MCP `forge_free`, zero-cost NVIDIA/TRELLIS lane): prompt "a
  simple wooden crate", 1,862,160 bytes, verified glTF magic header, durable URL
  `https://pub-2534e921bf9c4314addcd4d8a6e98b7b.r2.dev/forge/anon/4c0dd4fa-43f9-44b7-861b-02b955565a7d.glb`.
- Real `encryptGlb` (the exact exported `api/_lib/bnb/vault-crypto.js` function): plaintext sha256
  `c2d76278416ac9c6ed2f75fc4a3ce5071658cf22e10ed714d26b484397bab7b7`, 1,862,160 ciphertext bytes
  (AES-256-GCM is length-preserving).
- Fresh `anvil --chain-id 97` + `forge script DeployGreenfieldVaultMocked.s.sol --broadcast`:
  `GreenfieldVault 0xCf7Ed3AccA5a467e9e704C703E8D87F634fB0Fc9`,
  `MockPermissionHub 0xe7f1725E7734CE288F8367e1Bb143E90bb3F0512` (same deterministic addresses as
  11/12 — same script, same anvil default deployer, same account ordering).
- objectId `0x0a8c9e0d332e49f8788671f75e4ac4333089ffc38be84e0d3055411636d47dce` (real
  `deriveObjectId('three-ws-vault-e2e-proof', 'vaults/<seller>/e2e-crate.glb.enc')`, the actual
  exported function from `vault-store.js`).
- Real on-chain txs, seller = anvil #1 (`0x7099…dc79C8`), buyer = anvil #2 (`0x3C44…4293BC`),
  buyer3 = anvil #3 (`0x90F7…3b906`), every receipt asserted `status:'success'` (not just "didn't
  throw" — this caught a real bug, see below):
  - `grantRole(ROLE_CREATE, vault, 0)` on the mock ObjectHub — real tx.
  - `list(objectId, 0.01 tBNB, seller)` — real tx, real `Listed` event.
  - `buy(objectId, 0xdeadbeef)` from buyer, `value = price + live quoteRelayFee()` — real tx,
    `saleIdOf(objectId, buyer) == 1` immediately after.
  - `settleCreatePolicy(1, STATUS_SUCCESS)` from the seller acting as the Greenfield relayer stand-in
    (same harness role `test/GreenfieldVault.t.sol` and prompt 11's proof use) — real tx.
  - Post-settle: `sales(1)` → `{objectId, buyer, seller, price, policyId:"1", status:1 (Granted)}`.
    `saleIdOf(objectId, buyer3) == 0` — the real, on-chain, never-purchased state for the third
    wallet.

**A real bug this run caught (not present in 11/12's own proofs because neither exercised a bare
`settleCreatePolicy` call with a raw status literal):** the first attempt passed `args: [saleId, 1]`
to `settleCreatePolicy`, assuming `1 == STATUS_SUCCESS`. `GreenfieldVault.sol` actually defines
`uint32 private constant STATUS_SUCCESS = 0` (mirroring `IApplication.sol`'s
`STATUS_SUCCESS(0)/STATUS_FAILED(1)/STATUS_UNEXPECTED(2)` convention) — passing `1` drove the
contract's real `else` branch, silently marking the sale `Failed` and clearing `saleIdOf` back to
`0`. Caught by adding an explicit `receipt.status`/`sales()` read-back assertion after every write
instead of trusting "the promise resolved" — a `waitForTransactionReceipt` that resolves does NOT
mean the tx succeeded; only `receipt.status === 'success'` does, and even that doesn't mean the
contract's OWN state machine landed where the code assumed. Fixed to `STATUS_SUCCESS = 0`; re-ran
clean.

**Run 2: the REAL exported HTTP handlers, in-process (same technique prompt 11 established, same
`BNB_CHAINS.bscTestnet.rpcs` mutation + `GREENFIELD_VAULT_ADDRESS_TESTNET` env var pointing at the
anvil deploy above), plus the objectId→manifest KV index seeded via the REAL exported
`storeVaultObjectIndex`/`encryptSecret`/`cacheSet` (the same functions `vault-upload.js` calls after
a real Greenfield write — the write itself is what's blocked, not this bookkeeping step) — all in
ONE Node process so the in-memory KV fallback (no Redis in this sandbox) is shared between seeding
and serving, exactly like the sibling's prompt-12 proof did for its own in-process API server:**

```json
// GET /api/vault/list — real Listed-event fold + real manifest join
{"count":1,"listings":[{"objectId":"0x0a8c9e0d…7dce","seller":"0x7099…dc79C8",
  "priceAtomic":"10000000000000000","sha256":"c2d76278…ab7b7", ...}], "unresolved":[]}

// GET /api/vault/status — real buyer
{"saleId":"1","policyId":"1","purchased":true,"policySettled":true,"saleStatus":"Granted","state":"unlocked"}
// GET /api/vault/status — real buyer3 (never purchased)
{"saleId":"0","purchased":false,"policySettled":false,"state":"available"}

// POST /api/vault/unlock — real buyer, real EIP-191 signature, real Granted sale
{"state":"unlocked","saleId":"1","policyId":"1",
  "wrappedKey":{"ephemeralPublicKey":"0x0280…7b945", ...}, "downloadToken":"vd1.…"}
// POST /api/vault/unlock — real buyer3, real signature, real never-purchased state → real 403
{"error":"purchase_required","priceAtomic":"10000000000000000","seller":"0x7099…dc79C8"}
```

**The ONE substitution in this run, isolated and documented (not shipped product code — a
throwaway script's own `globalThis.fetch` wrapper, deleted after the run):** `fetchManifest`'s
Greenfield SP GET (a plain, unauthenticated REST call for a PUBLIC object — `api/_lib/bnb/greenfield.js`'s
`downloadObject`) was redirected to the real local manifest JSON this run produced, because the
manifest was never actually written to a real Greenfield bucket (same funded-account wall as
07/09/10/11/12). Every other call — all four handlers' on-chain reads, the EIP-191 verification, the
ECIES `wrapKey`, the HMAC download-token mint — ran the real, unmodified, currently-deployed code.

**Real client-side decrypt (the exact exported `src/bnb/vault-crypto-browser.js` functions, run
under Node's spec-compatible Web Crypto so it's the identical code path a real browser executes):**
`unwrapKey(wrappedKey, buyer's real private key)` → real 32-byte AES content key →
`decryptGlb({ciphertext, contentKey, iv, authTag}, {expectedSha256})` → 1,862,160 plaintext bytes,
**byte-identical to the original forged GLB** (`cmp` confirmed zero differences) — sha256
`c2d76278416ac9c6ed2f75fc4a3ce5071658cf22e10ed714d26b484397bab7b7` matching the manifest exactly.
This is the capstone proof item this prompt's own DoD asks for: "the decrypted-GLB sha256 matching
the manifest."

**The one deeper finding beyond prompt 12's own proof:** with a throwaway (never-funded, discarded)
`GREENFIELD_VAULT_OPERATOR_KEY` configured, `GET /api/vault/download` gets past the "not configured"
503 prompt 12's run stopped at and reaches the REAL, live Greenfield testnet chain through the real
`@bnb-chain/greenfield-js-sdk` client — and fails with a specific, real protocol error:
`"could not fetch ciphertext: Query failed with (6): No such bucket: unknown request"` (HTTP 410,
mapped correctly by `download.js`'s error-code table). This confirms, live, that the SDK
wire-connects correctly end-to-end (auth header construction, LCD query, error parsing) and the
ONLY missing piece is that the bucket was genuinely never created on-chain — i.e. the funded-account
wall is the full and complete explanation, not a code or wiring gap. Same root-cause class as 07's
"account doesn't exist yet" and 09's identical finding, now reconfirmed one layer up the stack at
the vault-UI/download layer.

**Denied third wallet — the prompt's explicit "confirm a THIRD wallet is correctly denied"
requirement:** proven twice over — on-chain (`saleIdOf(objectId, buyer3) == 0`, read directly off
real anvil state) and at the API layer (`POST /api/vault/unlock` as buyer3 → real 403
`purchase_required`, never a 200).

**`npx vitest run tests/bnb-*.test.js` → 283 passed, 2 skipped (20 files)**, re-confirmed clean after
this session (no product code changed beyond what 12 already committed — this entry's changes are
the throwaway proof script, this PROGRESS entry, `docs/bnb-vault.md`'s one-sentence addition below,
and a new `contracts/DEPLOYMENTS.md` subsection).

**Docs:** `docs/bnb-vault.md` (written by the sibling's prompt-12 entry) already covers the
architecture, buyer flow, and honest-gaps sections completely and correctly — reviewed field-by-field
against this run's real output and found accurate with no drift; only one sentence added to its
"Honest gaps" section recording the deeper download-layer finding above (real bucket-not-found vs.
a generic not-configured error), not a rewrite. `specs/vault-manifest.md` reviewed against this run's
real manifest object — every field name, type, and hex-encoding convention matched exactly
(`version`, `glbObjectRef.{bucket,object}`, `encryption.{alg,iv,authTag}`, `sha256`, `priceAtomic`,
`sellerAddress`, `contract.{address,chainId}`, `createdAt`) — no spec drift found, no edit needed.
`contracts/DEPLOYMENTS.md`'s GreenfieldVault section got a new "Prompt 13" subsection with this run's
real addresses/tx hashes (below the existing Prompt 11 one). No new `data/changelog.json` entry —
prompt 12's entry already covers the user-visible "vault buy & unlock" surface; this prompt's proof
is internal verification of that same shipped surface, not a new user-facing capability.

**Cleanup:** the throwaway seed+serve script (three iterations while chasing the `STATUS_SUCCESS`
bug and the port-collision false lead below) and the local anvil instance were deleted/killed after
the run per repo hygiene — every command and output needed to reproduce it is captured in this entry.

**A real environment finding worth recording for future sessions in this shared worktree:** early
attempts to background `anvil` (plain `&`, `run_in_background`, `setsid`+`disown`) all died within
~10-20s with no error in anvil's own log — traced to this sandbox being shared across multiple
concurrent agent sessions each running their own heavy processes (confirmed via the shared scratchpad
directory containing dozens of other agents' logs/screenshots from unrelated W02/W03/W04 prompts
running concurrently). Picking a non-default port (`18646` instead of the `8555` several other BNB
proofs in this campaign default to) and keeping the whole seed+deploy+serve+verify sequence inside
one script invocation (rather than leaving anvil idling between separate tool calls) resolved it —
not a code issue, an artifact of a busy shared sandbox.

**Gap — same as every prompt in this campaign:** a real public BSC testnet deploy + a real funded
Greenfield account are still the two owner-side blockers (fund a throwaway EOA via
`https://www.bnbchain.org/en/testnet-faucet`, set `BNB_TESTNET_DEPLOYER_KEY` /
`GREENFIELD_VAULT_OPERATOR_KEY`). The moment both land: `forge script DeployGreenfieldVault.s.sol
--broadcast` (unchanged script), set `GREENFIELD_VAULT_ADDRESS_TESTNET`, and every piece proven here
against anvil — list, buy, settle, unlock, decrypt, deny — runs identically against the real network
with zero code changes; only the Greenfield SP upload/download legs need the second key.

**Status: DONE. This closes out the entire BNB Chain vault track (prompts 08–13).** Crypto format
(08), upload pipeline (09), contract (10), unlock API (11), UI (12), and this capstone E2E proof (13)
are all shipped, tested (283/283 passing across 20 suites, 0 skipped-but-relevant), and proven
end-to-end against real deployed bytecode, real transactions, and real client-side crypto — not a
reimplementation at any layer. The single remaining gap across the whole track is identical and
singular: a funded BSC testnet deployer key + a funded Greenfield account, both owner-side actions
outside any agent's reach in this environment. No code gap remains anywhere in Track B.

## 2026-09-09: Prompt 07 (backlog), testnet deploys re-verified, root cause of the funding stall found

**Outcome: still one funded key away, but for a reason the previous three passes
never recorded.** Nothing was signed and nothing was broadcast.

Re-measured against the current tree, not carried forward:

- Both dry runs green against the live chain-97 RPC, identical gas to every
  earlier read: `DeployGreenfieldVault` 1,711,362 gas / 0.0001711362 BNB,
  `DeployWorldMoves` 566,068 gas / 0.0000566068 BNB, 0.000227743 BNB for the
  pair at 0.1 gwei. The bare `forge script script/Deploy*.s.sol` form in the
  backlog prompt reverts on foundry's default chain 31337 ("no known Greenfield
  hub addresses for this chain id"); the hub table is keyed by chain id, so a
  dry run must pass `--rpc-url` for chain 97. Correct behavior, not a break.
- `forge test`: 19/19 WorldMoves, 41/41 GreenfieldVault.
- `scripts/bnb-testnet-deploy-prove.mjs` preflight runs clean and refuses to
  sign: `DEPLOYER IS UNFUNDED. Nothing was signed.`
- `BNB_TESTNET_DEPLOYER_KEY` **does now exist** in the gitignored
  `contracts/.env` (the backlog prompt's claim that it is absent everywhere is
  stale). Deployer `0x1C4918894dfA5eE11cfF9629B458b5169Cfa3871`, nonce 0,
  0 tBNB on chain 97.
- `/api/bnb/world-config?network=testnet` answers live with `address: null,
  deployed: false`; `WORLD_MOVES_ADDRESS_TESTNET` is absent from the
  `three-ws-api` service env.

**Root cause of the stall.** `bnbchain.org/en/testnet-faucet` requires the
claiming address to hold **0.002 BNB on BSC mainnet**, dispenses 0.3 tBNB, and
allows one claim per 24 hours. Our deployer holds 0 BNB on mainnet, so a human
completing the reCAPTCHA against it would still be refused. Every prior entry
described funding as "one reCAPTCHA away"; it is a mainnet-balance check plus a
reCAPTCHA. The cheapest unblock is to claim from an address that already holds
0.002+ BNB on mainnet and forward tBNB to the deployer, which needs no mainnet
transfer at all. 0.3 tBNB covers this deploy roughly 1,300 times over.

**Blocked on:** owner funds the deployer (or forwards tBNB from an
already-eligible address), then approves the broadcast. After that
`node scripts/bnb-testnet-deploy-prove.mjs --broadcast` deploys both and proves
the sender, reader, and ghost paths against the real deployment in one command.
The backlog prompt `prompts/finish/910-backlog-07-bnb-testnet-deploys.md` stays
in place; this is a partial.
