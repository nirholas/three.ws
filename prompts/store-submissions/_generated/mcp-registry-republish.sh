# 1. Authenticate once (device flow / browser):
#   mcp-publisher login github

# 2. Publish each manifest whose local version is newer than (or absent from) the registry:

# io.github.nirholas/solana-memo-media-mcp: registry (none) -> local 0.1.1   [NEW]
mcp-publisher publish "packages/solana-memo-media-mcp/server.json"

# 3. Verify all versions match the manifests:
# node scripts/publish-mcp-servers.mjs --dry-run
