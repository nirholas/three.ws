# fix-queue: defects reproduced by running the repo's own checks

Every file here is a self-contained work order. Paste one into a fresh Claude
Code chat in this repo and run it to 100% without further input. Read this index
first; every work order assumes it.

Opened 2026-08-01. Each work order below was found by **running a check and
reading its output**, not by reading a tracker. The reproducing command and its
verbatim output are in the file. Nothing here is speculative, and nothing here
is a status claim inherited from an older document.

## Scope, and where the other work lives

This pack is the **repo and product defect queue**: things that are broken in
the code, the pages, or the build, and that an agent can fix here and now with
no external dependency.

The **infrastructure and owner-gated backlog** (x402 settle runway, Solana RPC
capacity, LLM lanes, R2 CORS, the fact-check benchmark, BNB testnet deploys, the
OKX chat bot, x402scan) lives in [../backlog/](../backlog/) and is not
duplicated here. Do not open a second work order for anything that pack owns;
extend that pack instead.

## Shared facts (verified 2026-08-01)

- **Production is current.** `GET https://three.ws/api/version` returns
  `6cc0370dc`, which is `main` HEAD, on revision `three-ws-api-00353-tzp`. So
  "it just needs a deploy" is not available as an explanation right now.
  Re-check anyway, because `main` moves.
- **`gcloud` auth works from this workspace** (`gcloud scheduler jobs list`
  succeeded). If a gcloud call returns `invalid_rapt`, that is the known
  Workspace reauth failure and needs one `gcloud auth login` from the owner. Do
  not redesign around it.
- **The gate is RED.** `npm run gate` exits 1 on `audit:hidden-guard`. Work
  order 01 fixes it. If you are running any other work order, capture that
  known-red baseline first so it is clear you did not cause it, and do not let
  it stop you.
- **Concurrent agents share this worktree.** Stage explicit paths, never
  `git add -A`, and re-read a file before editing it if your task has been
  running a while. This pack was itself trimmed on the day it was written
  because another agent shipped an overlapping pack an hour later.

## Rules that apply to every work order here

1. CLAUDE.md wins. No mocks, no fake data, no TODOs, no stubs, no commented-out
   code, no em-dash characters.
2. Do not stop to ask. The self-unblock playbook in CLAUDE.md covers every
   blocker these work orders can hit. Finish, then report.
3. Deploys and pushes stay owner-gated. Prepare everything so shipping is one
   command, and say so in your report.
4. A fix is not done until the verification command in the work order passes and
   the `data/changelog.json` entry is written for anything user-visible.

## The queue

| # | Work order | Severity | Reproduce with |
|---|---|---|---|
| 03 | [A declared cron has never run in production](../905-fix-queue-03-cron-drift-garment-sweep.md) | P1 | `npm run check:cron-drift` |

**One order left, and it is owner-gated.** Everything else this pack opened with
shipped and was retired; [PROGRESS.md](fix-queue-PROGRESS.md) carries what changed and the
verification output for each. Order 03's code-side questions are both answered
in that log (the first sweep is safe at `*/10`, and the drift check's home is
already registered in `data/guards.json`); what remains is creating the Cloud
Scheduler job, which needs a `gcloud auth login` this workspace does not have.

Retired 2026-08-13 after verification: 01 (gate green), 04 (tour atlas), 05
(stub hrefs), 06 (runnable docs), 07 (`test:core`), 08 (optimizer inflation).
Retired 2026-08-09: 02 (lint errors).

Checks that were green on 2026-08-01 and are not represented here, so you do not
re-run them hoping for work: `audit:docs` (1236 files), `audit:handlers` (1888
handlers), `audit:pages` (161 routes), `check:tutorials` (69/69),
`check:browser-graph` (1168 modules), `check:claude`, `audit:routes`,
`audit:mcp`, `audit:mcp-golden`, `audit:x402-catalog`, `audit:tokens`, and
`audit:links` for broken internal links (0; only the stub hrefs in 05 remain).

## When you finish one

Append a line to [PROGRESS.md](fix-queue-PROGRESS.md) with the date, the work order, what
you changed, and the verification output. That file is the only memory between
chats. Delete a work order file only when its fix is verified shipped, per the
retirement policy in [../README.md](../README.md).

## Retire this file when the campaign is done (required)

This file is shared context rather than a single order, so it outlives the
prompts that cite it. Delete it in the commit that closes the LAST prompt of
this campaign, once nothing else in `prompts/finish/` references it:

       grep -rl 'fix-queue-00-INDEX' prompts/finish/
       git rm prompts/finish/_context/fix-queue-00-INDEX.md

While any sibling prompt of this campaign is still on disk, leave this file in
place and keep it accurate instead. The shrinking directory is the only signal
to the next agent that a campaign is closed.
