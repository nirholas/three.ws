# Route audit: /ghost-copy (Ghost-copy: what if you'd copied them?)

How to run: paste this file's repo path into a fresh Claude Code chat in this
repository and say "run this work order". This file is fully self-contained:
it depends on no other prompt file anywhere. If sibling swarm-100 files in
prompts/finish/ are gone, that work is done; if present, ignore them.
Every claim below rots; step 0 re-measures, and what you measure wins.

## Operating clause (binding)

- Read CLAUDE.md first. Its rules override everything, including this file.
- Finish 100% in this session. Never end the turn with a question, an option
  list, or an unexecuted plan. A judgment call goes in one line of the final
  report; it never becomes a question that halts work.
- The only permitted stops are the CLAUDE.md stop-and-ask gates: spending real
  funds or any irreversible on-chain write, git push or a production deploy,
  committing content that references a crypto project other than $THREE, and
  destroying unrecoverable data.
- No mocks, no fake data, no placeholder stubs, no unfinished-work markers, no
  commented-out code. Real APIs and real integrations only.
- The em-dash and en-dash characters are banned in everything you write.
- Concurrent agents share this worktree: stage explicit paths only (never a
  bare add-everything), and commit finished work promptly.
- Before committing, run: npm run check:rules -- --paths <files you touched>.
  It must exit 0.

## Step 0: re-derive the current state

1. This route's declared entry (path, description, added date):

       node -e "const p=require('./data/pages.json');for(const s of p.sections)for(const g of s.pages)if(g.path==='/ghost-copy')console.log(JSON.stringify(g,null,2))"

2. Find the serving implementation: grep "/ghost-copy" in vercel.json (the live
   route table server/index.mjs boots from), then list matching files in
   pages/ and src/. STRUCTURE.md maps every surface to its directory if the
   grep is ambiguous.
3. Production right now:

       curl -so /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' https://three.ws/ghost-copy

4. Start (or reuse) the local dev server: npm run dev (vite, port 3000).

## Task: audit this one route end to end, then fix everything found

Route: /ghost-copy ("Ghost-copy: what if you'd copied them?", section "crypto").
Declared purpose: Paper-copy any verified pump.fun trader agent with fake money over their real closed on-chain trades. Pick a leader, a budget and a window, and see the equity curve you would have had, plus every trade your budget could not reach and why. No wallet, no signature, no custody, no account.

Drive the page in a real headless browser. Playwright is already a dev
dependency; keep your probe script in the session scratchpad, never in the
repo.

1. Load http://localhost:3000/ghost-copy. Record the HTTP status, every console
   error and warning, and every failed network request.
2. Exercise it like a first-time user: click the primary actions, run the
   primary flow if one exists, follow the page's internal links. Every button
   must do something real; every link must resolve. If the page renders data,
   prove in the network log that it came from a live endpoint, not a baked-in
   fallback array.
3. States: verify populated, empty, loading, and error states are designed and
   reachable. Block the page's primary fetch in Playwright and confirm an
   actionable error state appears, not a blank void or a raw exception.
4. Responsive: render at 320, 768, and 1440 px. No horizontal page scroll, no
   overlapping or clipped controls.
5. Accessibility basics: one h1; interactive elements are real buttons or
   links with visible focus states; images carry alt text; form fields have
   labels.
6. Head: a specific title tag and meta description that match the declared
   purpose above.
7. Fix every defect at its root in the page's real source files and re-run the
   probe until clean. Defects in shared modules are in scope when this route
   exercises them.

## Definition of done

- [ ] Local load of /ghost-copy: HTTP 200, zero console errors, zero unhandled
      failed requests (a third-party outage must land in a designed fallback,
      not a broken page).
- [ ] No dead interactive element on the page: no stub href="#", no button
      without a handler, no link to a missing path.
- [ ] Empty, loading, error, and populated states verified.
- [ ] 320 / 768 / 1440 px renders verified clean.
- [ ] Title and meta description present and specific.
- [ ] npm test passes; npm run check:rules -- --paths <touched files> exits 0.
- [ ] Production status from step 0 recorded in the report; if production
      needs a deploy to pick up a fix, the report says so (deploys stay
      owner-gated).

## Never blocked

| Blocker | Resolution (act, do not ask) |
|---|---|
| Missing env var or credential | Check .env and .env.local, then the Cloud Run service env, then Secret Manager (the CLAUDE.md self-unblock playbook has the exact commands). If it truly exists nowhere, wire the code fully behind the env var, prove the wiring with a dry run, and name the single missing var in the report. |
| gcloud not on PATH | Run: export PATH="$HOME/google-cloud-sdk/bin:$PATH" |
| Dev server port 3000 busy | Another agent may be serving this repo; probe it and reuse if so. Otherwise start your own on a free port: npx vite --port 3101 |
| Playwright browser missing | npx playwright install chromium |
| A surface needs a signed-in user | Register a fresh account through the real /register flow against the real API and use it. Never mock the session. |
| A defect sits in code you did not touch | Fix it if it blocks a Definition of done line (root cause it, never mask it). Otherwise note it in the report and continue. |
| An unrelated test is red | Same rule. Never pipe npm test through tail; it masks exit codes. |

## Close out (required)

1. Verify every Definition of done line with the actual command output in
   front of you. Never claim a line you did not verify.
2. Commit with explicit paths and a subject that describes the diff (house
   style: type(scope): what changed and why a reader cares).
3. Delete this prompt file in that same commit:

       git rm prompts/finish/159-swarm-100-route-ghost-copy.md

   The shrinking directory is this campaign's only progress ledger; there is
   no progress log to update.
4. Final report: what step 0 measured, what changed (file list), evidence per
   Definition of done line, and any one-line judgment calls. No trailing
   questions, no unexecuted plans.

If a line genuinely cannot pass inside this session (an external party must
respond, or an owner-gated action is the final step), finish everything else,
leave this file in place, and state exactly which line remains and who owns
it. Never delete this file on a partial.
