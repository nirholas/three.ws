# 14. Reliability and the scale envelope

**How to run this:** paste this whole file into a fresh Claude Code chat opened in
`/workspaces/three.ws`. Read [00-CONTEXT.md](_context/home-00-CONTEXT.md) first. Orders
[02](home-02-bridge-runtime.md), [03](home-03-api-surface.md) and
[13](home-13-observability.md) must have landed.

## Binding operating clause

Finish 100%. Never end with a question or an unexecuted plan. All CLAUDE.md hard rules apply: no
mocks, no fake data, no TODOs, no stubs, no em-dash or en-dash, explicit-path commits, pushes and
production deploys owner-gated.

**Measure, then state. Never assume a number.**

---

## Step 0: re-derive the current state

```bash
node -e "import('./api/_lib/home/runtime.js').then(m=>console.log(Object.keys(m)))"
gcloud run services describe three-ws-api --region us-central1 --format=yaml 2>/dev/null | grep -A5 -i "resources\|concurrency\|scal" | head -30
cat docs/ops/gcp-credits-plan.md | head -40
curl -s https://three.ws/api/healthz | head -c 300
```

## The envelope, measured at three volumes

Fill this table with **measured** numbers and publish it in `docs/home-operations.md`. Every cell
that says "assumed" is an unfinished line.

| Volume | Connections per instance | Heap | p95 action | Behaviour |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 10 homes | | | | everything inline, nothing to tune |
| 1,000 homes | | | | |
| 100,000 homes | | | | |

Measure the first two for real. For the third, measure the per-connection cost precisely and
extrapolate honestly, naming the extrapolation and its assumptions. A measured unit cost plus a
stated model is engineering; a guessed total is not.

The unit costs that matter, each measured:

- Heap per idle connection, and per connection for a large house (500+ entities).
- CPU per state burst of 100 entity updates.
- Socket count and file-descriptor headroom per instance.
- SSE stream cost per subscriber, separate from connection cost.
- Cold-start time to first connected home on a fresh instance.

## Backpressure and degradation, in order

The system must degrade in latency and features, never in correctness and never in safety. Write
the ladder down and implement it:

1. Under the per-instance cap: normal.
2. At the cap: new acquisitions get a short-lived unpooled connection. Slower, correct.
3. Under DB pressure: reads serve from the in-memory graph; writes still go through, because a
   write is somebody pressing a button.
4. Under severe load: SSE stream admission is limited before action admission is. **A user who
   asks to unlock a door gets served before a user who is watching a dashboard.**
5. Beyond that: `503` with `retry-after` and a designed UI state. Never a silent hang, never a
   half-applied action.

**The gate never degrades.** No load condition may cause a guarded action to skip a confirmation.
If shedding load would require weakening the gate, shed the action instead and say so.

## Chaos: the seven failures, each run for real

| # | Failure | Injected how | Must |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | House goes offline mid-session | stop the container | stale not empty, recovers on restart with no reload |
| 2 | House flaps (up, down, up) every 5 s for 2 minutes | a loop against the container | the breaker damps it; no alert storm; no socket leak |
| 3 | Token revoked while connected | delete the token in Home Assistant | connection moves to `auth_failed` with the real reason; the user is told to reconnect |
| 4 | Our instance recycled mid-stream | `docker restart` the API, or SIGTERM the process | streams reconnect client-side; sockets closed cleanly on the house's side |
| 5 | Database unavailable | point `DATABASE_URL` at a dead host | reads degrade to the in-memory graph, writes fail with a designed error, no crash loop |
| 6 | Slow house (2 s per response) | a latency shim in front of the container | timeouts bound it; one slow house does not slow others; prove isolation |
| 7 | 500-entity house with a 10-per-second update rate | the demo integration plus a generator | frame budget held in the UI, coalescing works, heap flat |

Failure 6 is the one that finds shared-resource bugs. Run it with a second, fast house connected
and prove the fast one is unaffected.

## Cloud Run configuration

Read `docs/ops/gcp-production.md` and `docs/ops/gcp-credits-plan.md` before changing anything.
CLAUDE.md pre-approves config-only `gcloud run services update` changes; a deploy is still
owner-gated.

Decide and justify, with the measured number behind each:

- Concurrency per instance (the current value, and whether long-lived SSE streams change it).
- Memory limit, from the measured heap plus headroom.
- Whether this lane needs a `minScale` above zero, and the honest cost of saying yes. Default is
  no: the pool is a cache, cold starts are sub-second, and paying to keep sockets warm is a
  decision that needs a measured latency complaint behind it.
- CPU throttling behaviour with an idle SSE stream open, which is the setting most likely to be
  wrong for this workload. Test it, do not reason about it.

## Tasks

| # | Task |
|---|---|
| 1 | A load harness that opens N real connections against N real Home Assistant containers (or one instance with N tokens, stated either way). `scripts/home-load.mjs`. |
| 2 | Measure every unit cost above. Record the raw output in `tasks/home/` as evidence, the way `tasks/sim-readiness/` does. |
| 3 | Implement the backpressure ladder. |
| 4 | Run all seven chaos scenarios and fix what they break. |
| 5 | Decide and apply the Cloud Run configuration, with the justification. |
| 6 | Publish the envelope table in `docs/home-operations.md`. |

## Definition of done

- [ ] The envelope table has measured numbers for 10 and 1,000 homes and a stated extrapolation for 100,000. No cell says "assumed".
- [ ] Every unit cost measured, with the raw evidence file committed under `tasks/home/`.
- [ ] All seven chaos scenarios run, with a transcript each, and every failure they exposed fixed.
- [ ] Scenario 6 proves isolation: the fast house's p95 is unchanged with a slow house connected. Paste both numbers.
- [ ] The backpressure ladder is implemented and each rung is demonstrated, including that action admission survives longer than stream admission.
- [ ] A load test proves the gate never degrades: guarded actions under saturation still require confirmation. Assert it.
- [ ] The Cloud Run configuration decision is written down with its measured justification, including the CPU-throttling test result.
- [ ] `npx vitest run --root .` shows no new failures.
- [ ] `npm run audit:docs` clean, `npm run check:rules -- --paths <your files>` clean.

## Never blocked

| Blocker | Do this |
|---|---|
| Cannot run 1,000 Home Assistant containers | You do not need to. Measure the per-connection cost precisely with 10 to 50 real ones, then drive the pool with a protocol-level load generator for the connection count. State exactly which part was real and which was generated. |
| The 100,000 number needs a distributed design | Then say so, with the measured point where the single-instance model breaks and what the next architecture is. An honest ceiling with a named successor beats a fabricated capacity. |
| Tempted to raise `minScale` to fix a cold start | Measure the cold start first. Sub-second is fine and free. Credits are approved for quality, but paying to hide a problem you have not measured is not quality. |
| A chaos scenario reveals a bug in `packages/home-bridge` | Fix it there, add a test there, and per the CLAUDE.md open-source rule, upstream anything that belongs to `home-assistant-js-websocket`. |
| The load harness would hammer a third party | It must only ever point at your own containers. Never load-test somebody's house. |

## Retire this prompt when it is done (required)

Verify every line against real output, append to `prompts/finish/_context/home-PROGRESS.md`, commit with
explicit paths, and delete this file in that commit:

       git rm prompts/finish/309-home-14-reliability-scale.md

Never delete it on a partial.
