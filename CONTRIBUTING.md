## How to Contribute

### Report a Bug

1. Check [existing issues](https://github.com/nirholas/3d-agent/issues) to avoid duplicates
2. Open a [new issue](https://github.com/nirholas/3d-agent/issues/new) with:
    - Browser and OS
    - Steps to reproduce
    - Expected vs. actual behavior
    - Console errors (if any)
    - The model file (if possible) or a link to a public glTF sample that triggers the issue

### Suggest a Feature

Open an issue with the **Feature Request** label. Describe:

- The use case (what problem does it solve?)
- Proposed behavior
- Any UI mockups or examples from other tools

### Submit a Pull Request

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch from `main`:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feat/my-feature
    ```
3. Make your changes
4. Format your code:
    ```bash
    npx prettier --write .
    ```
5. Test locally with `npm run dev`

## Commit Messages

Use clear, descriptive commit messages. Conventional format is preferred:

| Prefix      | Use                                |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `feat:`     | New feature                        |
| `fix:`      | Bug fix                            |
| `docs:`     | Documentation only                 |
| `style:`    | Formatting, no logic change        |
| `refactor:` | Code restructuring                 |
| `perf:`     | Performance improvement            |
| `chore:`    | Build, tooling, dependency updates |

## Code Guidelines

- **Formatting:** Run `npx prettier --write .` before committing
- **No new dependencies** without discussion — keep the bundle small
- **Browser compatibility:** Must work in Chrome, Firefox, and Edge. Safari support is best-effort
- **No server-side code** — the app must remain 100% client-side
- **Dispose resources** — any new Three.js objects (geometries, materials, textures) must be disposed in `Viewer.clear()`
- **Blob URL cleanup** — any `URL.createObjectURL()` must have a corresponding `URL.revokeObjectURL()`

## Testing Your Changes

### Manual Testing Checklist

Before submitting a PR, verify:

- [ ] Default model (`cz.glb`) loads on page open
- [ ] Drag-and-drop works with a `.glb` file
- [ ] Drag-and-drop works with a multi-file `.gltf` (separate `.bin` + textures)
- [ ] URL loading works: `http://localhost:3000/#model=<url>`
- [ ] All GUI controls respond (display, lighting, animation if applicable)
- [ ] Validation toggle appears and clicking it opens a report
- [ ] Responsive layout works on a narrow viewport (≤ 700 px)
- [ ] No console errors after loading a model
- [ ] `window.VIEWER` debugging API still works

### Test Models

Use the [Khronos glTF Sample Assets](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Assets):

| Model          | Tests                              |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Damaged Helmet | PBR materials, environment mapping |
| Fox            | Skinned mesh, animation            |
| Flight Helmet  | Multi-texture, display controls    |
| Box            | Minimal model, basic rendering     |
| Animated Cube  | Animation playback                 |
