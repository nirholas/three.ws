// using the `.spec.js` suffix in `tests/e2e/`.

// Cold-start budget: a fresh Vite dev server needs ~30s to come up and the
// first /club hit then transforms the full three.js module graph (~30–60s
// on a CI box). The first test sets a 180s test timeout; we mirror that on
// the webServer health check so playwright doesn't kill the server before
// the cold transform finishes and bring down the next two tests with it.
