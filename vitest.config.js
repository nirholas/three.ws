// is only ever loaded LAZILY — every importer (api/_lib/agora-human.js,
// api/agora/[action].js) reaches it via `await import()` so the module loads
// even where the SDK's dist/ isn't built yet. Vite's import-analysis still
// resolves that dynamic specifier's package entry at transform time, so when
// dist/ is transiently absent (fresh checkout before postinstall, or a
// concurrent `tsup --clean` rebuild) an import-only test like
// tests/agora-humans.test.js dies with "Failed to resolve entry for package"
// before any test runs. Marking the package external short-circuits that
// transform-time entry resolution: the lazy import resolves natively at runtime
// instead, and only when a test actually exercises an on-chain path (the
// pure-logic suites never do). server.deps.external alone doesn't cover this —
// import-analysis resolves the importing source regardless — so we intercept at
// the resolver.

// Cold dynamic `import()` of API handlers that pull in heavy SDKs (@coinbase/x402,

// the first hit in constrained CI/Codespace environments. Individual tests that
// do real I/O still carry their own tighter timeouts; this ceiling only protects
// import-heavy module-load tests like the onchain adapter factory.
//
// Parallelism: on Codespaces / small CI workers the default (cpus - 1) workers
// melt the box — heavy ESM cold-imports across files compete for memory and
// repeatedly miss their hookTimeout. We cap forks at min(4, cpus - 1) so worker
// startup never queues behind a busy peer. Locally on a beefy machine
// (CPUs > 4) this still parallelizes; small hosts get safe serialisation.
// On CI / Codespaces the box is small (typically 2-4 cores, capped memory),
// and heavy ESM cold-imports across files compete for the same V8 instance.
// We cap forks at 2 for hosts with <=4 cores so cold loads aren't blocked by
// peer workers. Beefier machines (>4 cores) parallelise up to (cpus - 1, max 6).
