//     gateway only" (gatewaychanges.ipfs.io), so <img>, fetch() and texture
//     loads against them all fail. pump.fun metadata still hands out ipfs.io URLs.

/**
 * Route an external image URL through the same-origin /api/img proxy.

 * blocking, retired hosts, and TLS interception on filtered networks. The
 * proxy fetches server-side with multi-gateway IPFS retry and always answers
 * with a valid image (deterministic placeholder on total failure), so the
 * loader never errors. Same-origin, relative, data:image and blob: URLs pass
 * through untouched; the proxy only earns its keep cross-origin.
 *
 * Anything that is not a renderable image source (javascript:, data:text/html,
 * file:, an over-long URL) resolves to '' so callers fall through to their own
 * "no art" branch instead of pushing a hostile value into an image sink.
 *
 * `width` asks the proxy for a copy no wider than that many pixels, re-encoded
 * as WebP (it snaps up to a fixed ladder, so a caller cannot mint unbounded
 * edge variants). Token art is stored at whatever size its creator uploaded:
 * four coins in the /play world pulled 2.7 MB of full-size PNGs for textures
 * that are a few hundred pixels on screen. Pass the size the art is actually
 * used at; leave it off to get the original bytes.
 *
 * `fallback: 'none'` asks the proxy for 204 No Content instead of the gem when
 * every source fails. Use it wherever the surface already designs its own "no
 * image" state (the neutral logo disc on the DeFi tables): the browser logs
 * nothing for a 204, and the <img> still fires `error`, so the designed state
 * renders and the console stays clean. Leave it off for token art, which wants
