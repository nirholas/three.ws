# src/scene-studio

Scene Studio, the full 3D scene editor served at [`/scene`](../../pages/scene.html).
Import GLB models, arrange them with transform gizmos, edit materials and lights,
script objects, play the scene, and export the result as GLB, USDZ, or a
publishable app zip.

## Why this exists

Building a scene editor from scratch is a solved problem: the three.js project
ships one. Instead of reinventing it, this directory vendors the upstream
`editor/` from three.js r184 (MIT, see [vendor/LICENSE](vendor/LICENSE)) and
wraps it with a handful of thin sibling modules that adapt it to three.ws. The wrappers
never modify `vendor/**`; every local change to upstream files is documented in
[vendor/README.md](vendor/README.md) so re-vendoring on a three upgrade stays
mechanical.

The wrappers are what make it a three.ws surface rather than a mirror of the
upstream demo: models forged on `/forge` or `/forge-max` deep-link straight into
the scene, animations baked on `/pose` hand off through IndexedDB, and any
composed scene can be exported with one click or uploaded and embedded on
another site. They also close the gaps the upstream demo never had to care
about: a first-run empty state, accessible names on the icon-only transform and
animation-transport buttons, a sidebar that fits a 320px screen instead of
overflowing it, and failures that surface in the platform's own toast instead of
a native `alert()`.

│                    autosave, drag-and-drop import, and the deep-link importers
├── loader.js        Shared GLB loader: Draco/KTX2/Meshopt-wired GLTFLoader that
│                    adds a parsed GLB through the undo-able AddObjectCommand path
├── actions.js       Layered action bar: Import from Forge, Export presets, Share
├── empty-state.js   First-run overlay over the empty grid, retires on first object
├── toolbar-a11y.js  Accessible names for the icon-only controls: the transform
│                    gizmos (plus pressed state) and the animation transport
├── studio.css       three.ws chrome overrides (vendor css/main.css is untouched)
└── vendor/          three.js r184 editor source (see vendor/README.md)
```

Static runtime assets (Draco/Basis decoders, toolbar icons, CodeMirror and the
other classic-script libs, the publish-zip template) live under
[public/scene-studio/](../../public/scene-studio) and are documented in
[vendor/README.md](vendor/README.md). The classic-script libs load as plain
`<script>` tags in [pages/scene.html](../../pages/scene.html), exactly as
upstream's `index.html` does.

## Usage

There is nothing to install. The page is part of the main Vite app:

```bash
npm run dev        # then open http://localhost:3000/scene
```

[pages/scene.html](../../pages/scene.html) loads `/src/scene-studio/main.js` as
a module; `main.js` mounts the editor into the `#studio-app` container under the
site nav. The surface is dark-locked: the entry module re-pins
`data-theme="dark"` because the editor chrome only ships dark.

Scenes autosave to IndexedDB through the vendored `editor.storage` on every
geometry, material, script, or scene-graph change, so a reload restores the last
state. For debugging, `main.js` exposes `window.editor` and `window.THREE` in
the browser console.

### Deep links

- `/scene?model=<glb_url>&name=<label>` adds the GLB at that URL to the scene
  through the normal undo-able import path, then strips the query from the
  address bar so a reload does not import a duplicate. This is the "Open in
  Scene Studio" hand-off used by Forge and Forge Max results. Only `https://`
  and same-origin `/` URLs are accepted.
- `/scene?handoff=1` pulls a baked GLB (mesh plus embedded animation clip) that
  the Animation Studio at `/pose` stashed in IndexedDB via
  [src/shared/scene-handoff.js](../shared/scene-handoff.js), adds it to the
  scene, and attaches a player script that drives an `AnimationMixer` so the
  clip plays in the timeline and records through Render, Video.
- `/scene#file=<url>` (upstream behavior) loads a serialized editor JSON scene
  after a confirmation prompt.

### Action bar

`actions.js` mounts a toolbar layered over the vendored chrome with three
affordances the stock File and Export menus do not offer on their own:

- **Import from Forge**: paste a GLB URL from a Forge or Forge Max result into
  the platform's own dialog (the shared `<dialog>` `Modal`, with inline
  validation for a non-`https` link) and drop the model straight into the scene.
  A fetch that fails is explained in a toast that names the likely cause and
  points at drag-and-drop as the fallback.
- **Export presets**: one click for a Web GLB (binary, with cloned and optimized
  animation clips, identical to File, Export, GLB) or an AR bundle (.usdz for
  iOS Quick Look).
- **Share**: exports the scene as a GLB, uploads it via
  [api/scene-glb-upload.js](../../api/scene-glb-upload.js) (presigned PUT), and
  opens the platform's "Embed this model" panel from
  [src/forge-embed-panel.js](../forge-embed-panel.js), the same modal Forge
  results use.

## Exports

The wrappers export seven functions; `main.js` is entry-only and exports nothing.

| Module | Export | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `loader.js` | `addGltfBufferToScene(editor, contents, label?)` | Parses a GLB `ArrayBuffer` with the Draco/KTX2/Meshopt-wired loader and adds it via `AddObjectCommand` (undo-able, autosave-triggering, outliner-visible). Resolves to the added `THREE.Object3D`. |
| `actions.js` | `mountStudioActions(editor, container)` | Mounts the Import from Forge / Export / Share bar into the studio container. Returns the bar element. |
| `actions.js` | `openImportDialog(editor, triggerEl?)` | Opens the import dialog and, on a confirmed URL, fetches and adds the model. Shared with the empty state so both entry points behave identically. |
| `actions.js` | `sceneTitle(editor)` | The scene's own name, or a stable fallback, for the Share embed panel's label. |
| `actions.js` | `describeImportFailure(error)` | Turns an `HTTP 4xx` / `Failed to fetch` into copy that names the likely cause. |
| `empty-state.js` | `mountEmptyState(editor, container)` | Mounts the first-run overlay and keeps it in sync with the scene graph. Returns the overlay element. |
| `toolbar-a11y.js` | `enhanceToolbarA11y(editor, toolbarDom)` | Labels the vendored translate/rotate/scale buttons and mirrors their `selected` class into `aria-pressed`. Returns the labelled buttons. |
| `toolbar-a11y.js` | `enhanceAnimationA11y(editor, animationDom)` | Labels the vendored animation timeline's play/pause/stop transport, which ships as three identical unnamed icon buttons. Matches each one on the SVG shape the vendor draws, not on child order, so a control added to that panel can never inherit the wrong label. Returns the labelled buttons. |

## Example

This is how `actions.js` imports a Forge result into the scene, using the shared
loader (trimmed from `openImportDialog` in [actions.js](actions.js)):

```js
import { addGltfBufferToScene } from './loader.js';
import { describeImportFailure } from './actions.js';
import { toastError } from '../shared/toast.js';

// `editor` is the vendored Editor instance (window.editor on /scene).
// `url` is an https GLB link the user confirmed in the import dialog.
const base = decodeURIComponent(url.split('?')[0].split('/').pop() || '');
const label = (base.replace(/\.(glb|gltf)$/i, '') || 'Forge model').slice(0, 64);
try {
  const res = await fetch(url);
  if (!res.ok) throw new Error('HTTP ' + res.status);
  await addGltfBufferToScene(editor, await res.arrayBuffer(), label);
} catch (error) {
  toastError(`Could not import that model: ${describeImportFailure(error)}.`);
}
```

Both callers of the loader (the `?model=` deep link in `main.js` and the action
bar above) go through this one function, so a GLB added either way decodes and
behaves identically to a manual drag-and-drop import.
