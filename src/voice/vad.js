/**
 * Voice activity detection for the browser voice loop.
 *
 * A thin, lazily loaded wrapper over silero-vad (MIT,
 * https://github.com/snakers4/silero-vad) through @ricky0123/vad-web. We do not
 * write a detector: silero is a trained model with years of tuning behind it and
 * an energy threshold is not a substitute.
 *
 * Two things this wrapper adds over calling MicVAD directly, and both are
 * load-bearing for the home voice loop:
 *
 *  1. It never opens the microphone itself. The caller passes the MediaStream
 *     and the AudioContext it already owns, so the VAD, the wake word and the
 *     utterance capture all read ONE mic. Three getUserMedia calls would mean
 *     three indicator dots in the browser chrome and three tracks to remember to
 *     stop, and "mute" has to stop every track that exists.
 *  2. It surfaces every 512-sample, 16 kHz frame to the caller. The wake word
 *     needs exactly that feed, and running a second resampler for it would
 *     double the audio work for no gain.
 *
 * Everything here loads on demand. Nothing in this module's dependency graph is
 * fetched until start() is called, which is what makes "nothing about listening
 * loads before you opt in" a true statement rather than a promise.
 *
 * Model: silero v5, 512-sample frames at 16 kHz, so 32 ms per frame. The v5
 * frame is the reason we do not use the legacy model: its 1536-sample frame is
 * 96 ms, which is a quarter of the entire end-of-speech budget in granularity
 * alone.

 * what matters because the deadline is checked once per frame. It is not 12
 * frames (384 ms) because the wall-clock gap a user actually experiences runs
 * from the last frame silero rated as speech to the moment the utterance closes,
 * and that is one frame period longer than the configured window: measured at
 * 412 to 424 ms with 12 frames, which misses the budget. Eleven frames measures
