// The pre-baked library in /public/animations/clips addresses tracks by the
// canonical Avaturn bone names (Hips, Spine, LeftArm, …). A loaded GLB rig might
// name the same bones `mixamorig:Hips`, `DEF-spine`, `left_arm`, etc. To drive
// (and export) that rig we rewrite each track's bone name to the *actual* node
// name on the target, drop tracks the rig has no bone for, and rescale the hip
// translation so root motion lands at the new rig's height instead of the
// authoring rig's. We retarget only the true-motion channels — joint rotations
// and the root (Hips) translation — and skip the clips' per-bone position/scale
// channels, which encode the *authoring* rig's bone lengths and would crush a
// differently-proportioned avatar into a heap. The result binds cleanly in both
// THREE.AnimationMixer (preview) and THREE.GLTFExporter (animated-GLB export).
//
// Pure module — three + the canonicalizer only — so it runs unchanged in the
