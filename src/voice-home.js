/**
 * /voice/home: the hands-free voice loop, mounted on its own surface.
 *
 * The panel here is the same HomeVoicePanel that /home/:id mounts over the live
 * 3D house. Keeping one component and two hosts is what stops the voice path and
 * the scene path from drifting into two different confirmation flows, which is
 * the exact failure that ends with a door opening on a "yeah".
 *
 * The state gallery below is not a mockup. It builds twelve real panels over
 * twelve real loops and drives each into one state through the same code path
 * the live loop uses, so what is rendered is what a user gets. No microphone is
 * opened for any of them, and no model is downloaded.
