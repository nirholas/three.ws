// Reputation Staking Market — the pure earnings engine.
//
// Stakers back an agent with escrowed lamports; the agent's ATTESTED ACTION
// HISTORY decides what that conviction earns. This module is the only place the
// weights, the epoch math, and the distribution rule exist. It is the executable
// form of specs/REPUTATION_STAKING_MARKET.md §5.
//
// Intentionally PURE: no I/O, no imports. The same functions run
// server-authoritatively in api/_lib/reputation-market.js (which does the real
// chain + index reads) and in the browser on /reputation/market, so a staker can
// re-derive every lamport the server quotes them. Unit-tested in
// tests/reputation-staking.test.js.
//
// ── Design principles (read before touching the weights) ─────────────────────
//
//   1. Every input is a signed, indexed attestation that already exists on
//      Solana (api/_lib/solana-attestations.js). Nothing here invents activity.
//
//   2. Conviction is not work. Stake and unstake attestations contribute zero to
//      the yield they earn; otherwise the market would pay itself.
//
//   3. Faults cost double what work pays, so a failed validation is never
//      cancelled out by the passed one next to it.
//
//   4. Yield is concave in activity (log2), so spraying cheap attestations does
//      not buy proportional yield.
//
//   5. The pool is a fixed per-epoch budget, never a rate. The market can never
//      owe more than the escrow holds.
//
//   6. An agent with no attested work earns its stakers nothing. Idle is not
//      punished, it is simply unpaid.
