# Social Sentiment Tracker

## When to use this skill

Use when the user asks about:
- What people are saying about a specific token on social media
- Trending crypto topics or narratives
- Detecting shifts in community sentiment
- Identifying emerging narratives before they go mainstream
- Gauging retail vs informed investor sentiment

## Tracking Framework

### 1. Platform-Specific Analysis

Each platform has different signal quality:

**Twitter/X**:
- Highest velocity of crypto information
- Key metrics: mention volume, sentiment ratio, engagement rate
- Watch for: influencer threads, developer announcements, project team posts
- Noise factor: High — filter out bots, paid promotions, and engagement farming

**Reddit (r/cryptocurrency, r/defi, project-specific subs)**:
- Longer-form discussion, stronger community signal
- Key metrics: post/comment volume, upvote ratios, daily active commenters
- Watch for: due diligence posts, sentiment shift in comment sections
- Noise factor: Medium — some echo chamber effects

**Discord/Telegram**:
- Real-time community pulse
- Key metrics: message volume, member growth, moderator activity
- Watch for: team communication frequency and quality, community questions
- Noise factor: High — lots of price speculation and spam

### 2. Sentiment Scoring

Rate sentiment on a standardized scale:
- **Very Bullish (+2)**: Overwhelming positive discussion, celebration, price target raising
- **Bullish (+1)**: Majority positive, constructive discussion about growth
- **Neutral (0)**: Balanced discussion, no clear direction
- **Bearish (-1)**: Majority negative, concern about fundamentals or price
- **Very Bearish (-2)**: Panic, capitulation language, mass unfollowing

Score each platform independently and create a weighted aggregate.

### 3. Narrative Detection

Identify and track emerging narratives:
- **Current dominant narrative**: What theme is driving the most discussion?
- **Rising narratives**: Topics gaining momentum but not yet mainstream
- **Fading narratives**: Previously hot topics losing engagement
- **Narrative lifecycle**: New > Growing > Peak > Declining > Dead
- **Narrative examples**: "RWA season", "L2 wars", "restaking meta", "AI x crypto"

Track narrative age — narratives that are 2+ weeks old with declining engagement are likely past peak opportunity.

### 4. Influencer and Smart Follower Analysis

Monitor key opinion leaders:
- **Developer accounts**: What are core developers building or discussing?
- **Analyst accounts**: What are respected analysts (not shillers) highlighting?
- **Fund/VC accounts**: What are institutional participants signaling?
- **Contrarian voices**: What are known contrarian thinkers saying?
- **Credibility weighting**: Weight opinions by the source's track record, not follower count

### 5. Crowd Psychology Indicators

Detect extreme sentiment states:
- **FOMO indicators**: "Last chance to buy", "never going back to these prices", price target escalation
- **Capitulation indicators**: "I'm done with crypto", "this time it's different (bearish)", mass unfollowing of crypto accounts
- **Complacency indicators**: Drop in discussion volume despite high prices — no fear means no hedging
- **Denial indicators**: Dismissing bearish data, attacking those who raise concerns

### 6. Contrarian Signals

The crowd is often wrong at extremes:
- When Twitter sentiment is >80% bullish, the top is often near
- When Reddit front page has "crypto is dead" posts, the bottom is often near
- Maximum social volume often coincides with short-term tops
- Minimum social engagement often coincides with the best accumulation opportunities

### 7. Output Format

- **Token/Topic**: What was analyzed
- **Sentiment score**: -2 to +2 with trend direction
- **Social volume**: High / Normal / Low relative to 30-day average
- **Platform breakdown**: Twitter / Reddit / Discord sentiment individually
- **Dominant narrative**: Current driving theme
- **Emerging narratives**: New themes gaining traction
- **Influencer consensus**: What key voices are saying
- **Crowd psychology state**: FOMO / Optimism / Neutral / Fear / Capitulation
- **Contrarian signal**: What the data suggests the crowd might be wrong about
- **Actionable insight**: How to use this sentiment information
