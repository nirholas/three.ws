# Crypto News Summary

## When to use this skill

Use when the user asks about:
- Recent crypto market news and developments
- What's happening in the crypto space today/this week
- News that might affect a specific token or sector
- Major regulatory, technical, or market events
- Summarizing multiple news sources into key takeaways

## Summary Framework

### 1. News Categorization

Organize news into impact tiers:

**Market-Moving (Immediate attention)**:
- Regulatory decisions (SEC actions, country-level bans/adoptions)
- Major protocol exploits or hacks (> $10M)
- Significant exchange events (insolvency, listings, delistings)
- Macro events affecting crypto (rate decisions, banking crises)
- Major protocol upgrades or launches

**Notable (Monitor and track)**:
- Protocol governance proposals with significant implications
- Funding rounds and partnerships
- Token unlock events and large OTC deals
- Developer ecosystem changes (new tools, standards)
- DeFi TVL shifts and protocol migrations

**Background (Awareness level)**:
- Conference announcements
- Minor protocol updates
- Ecosystem growth metrics
- Community developments

### 2. News Analysis Template

For each significant news item:
- **Headline**: Concise factual summary
- **Source**: Where the news originated (official announcement, reporting, on-chain data)
- **Affected assets**: Which tokens or protocols are directly impacted
- **Market impact**: Positive / Negative / Neutral — and magnitude (minor, moderate, major)
- **Time sensitivity**: Act now / Monitor / No urgency
- **Verification status**: Confirmed / Unconfirmed / Developing

### 3. Sector Impact Assessment

Map news to sector effects:
- **DeFi**: Protocol TVL changes, new primitives, exploit aftermath
- **Layer 1/L2**: Network performance, adoption metrics, upgrade timelines
- **Regulatory**: Which jurisdictions, enforcement vs guidance, compliance deadlines
- **NFTs/Gaming**: Market activity, major project developments
- **Infrastructure**: Oracle, bridge, RPC, and tooling developments
- **Macro**: Interest rates, inflation data, traditional finance crossover

### 4. Signal vs Noise Filtering

Help users focus on what matters:
- **Signal**: Events that change fundamental value or create immediate risks/opportunities
- **Noise**: Recycled narratives, influencer opinions without data, clickbait price predictions
- **Context**: Place news in broader market context — is this a one-time event or a trend?
- **Contrarian check**: Is the market overreacting or underreacting to this news?

### 5. Portfolio Relevance Mapping

If the user has shared their holdings:
- Flag news items that directly affect their portfolio assets
- Assess whether any action is needed (adjust positions, review risk)
- Highlight opportunities that align with their existing strategy
- Note any new risks introduced by current events

### 6. Output Format

Present as a structured briefing:

**Top Stories** (3-5 most important):
1. Story title — impact level — affected assets
2. Story title — impact level — affected assets
3. Story title — impact level — affected assets

**Sector Summary**:
