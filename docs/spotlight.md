# Agent Spotlight

[**`/spotlight`**](https://three.ws/spotlight) is the three.ws community
showcase. [`/agents`](https://three.ws/agents) is the directory: every agent
anyone ever registered, which is thousands of rows and most of them still wearing
the onboarding default name. The spotlight is the other half of that, the curated
layer where a person says what an agent is for and the community votes on whether
they were right.

An entry is a **pitch attached to a live agent**, never a copy of it. The entry
stores a headline, a one-liner, an optional write-up, a category, up to six tags
and an optional demo link. Everything else on the card (the agent's name,
description, skills, avatar, on-chain identity, conversation count and builder)
is read from `agent_identities` on every request. Rename your agent, swap its
avatar, register it on-chain: the card updates with it, and there is no stale
copy to go wrong.

## Submitting

1. Make the agent public. Private agents are excluded: the showcase links
   straight to `/agents/<id>` and an entry a visitor cannot open is worse than
   no entry.
2. Open `/spotlight`, click **Showcase your agent**, and pick it from the
   dropdown. Only your own public agents that are not already showcased appear.
3. Write the headline (3 to 90 characters) and the one-liner (10 to 160). The
   one-liner is pre-filled from the agent's own description so you are editing
   rather than starting from nothing.
4. Optional: a write-up of up to 4,000 characters, a demo link, and tags.

**One entry per agent.** Submitting again for the same agent edits the entry you
already have; it never creates a second card.

## The entry page

Every entry has its own page at `/spotlight/<entry id>`. That is where the
write-up is actually readable (the index can only show three clamped lines of
it), and it is the one place an entry is edited after it is created:

- the agent standing in 3D, live from its own GLB. Its still image holds the
  stage until `<agent-3d>` fires `agent:ready` (the body is already standing in
  its idle by then), and the two swap in the same frame, so exactly one avatar
  is ever on screen. If the viewer fails to boot (`agent:error`) it is removed
  and the still stays, so a model that fails to load degrades to the avatar
  picture rather than an empty stage
  ([`revealWhenReady()` in `src/spotlight-shared.js`](../src/spotlight-shared.js)),
- the full write-up as real paragraphs,
- a facts panel read live off the agent on every request: skills, conversations,
  on-chain actions, network, upvotes, views,
- share controls, and links into the agent in 3D, its profile, and AR,
- for the entry's owner (the submitter, or the agent's owner): **Edit entry** and
  **Remove**, the latter behind a two-step confirmation.

Owners reach the editor from a card's `Edit` link on the index, which deep-links
to `/spotlight/<id>?edit=1` and opens the form scrolled and focused. Both forms
are built by the same module, [`src/spotlight-form.js`](../src/spotlight-form.js),
so the create and edit paths cannot drift apart.

## Ranking

Three sorts share one page.

| Sort | What it orders by |
| --- | --- |
| **Trending** (default) | Upvotes with time decay, so new work is visible |
| **Newest** | Publication time |
| **Most upvoted** | Raw upvote count, all time |

Trending decays with age:

```
score = (upvotes + 1) / (age_in_days + 1) ^ 1.2
```

Two things about that formula are deliberate.

The `+ 1` in the numerator means an entry published five minutes ago with no
votes still scores `1.0` and lands on the first page, so the newest submission is
seen at all rather than buried under whatever was already popular.

The clock runs in **days**, not hours. The hour-scaled version of this curve that
every ranked feed copies from Hacker News assumes enough vote volume that a good
post gains score faster than it loses it inside a day. At this surface's volume
it does not: that curve puts a 24-hour-old entry at about 2% of a fresh one, so
any brand-new empty entry outranks a week-old entry everybody liked, and
"trending" quietly becomes "newest". On the day scale a day-old entry still
carries a bit under half the weight of a fresh one, a week-old entry with twenty
upvotes stays above a fresh empty one, and a month-old entry finally rotates off
the front page. That is the behaviour a showcase wants: durable good work near
the top, always room for the newest.

The formula lives in one place,
[`trendingScore()` in `api/_lib/spotlight-store.js`](../api/_lib/spotlight-store.js),
and the SQL `ORDER BY` computes the identical expression so the server never
disagrees with its own documentation.

One upvote per account per entry, and voting again removes it. Votes are counted
on read rather than stored as a running total, so a lost write can never leave a
counter permanently wrong.

## Curated entries

Some entries carry a **Curated** badge. Those were written by three.ws about
someone else's public agent, and the badge exists so a visitor is never told a
builder said something they did not write. The builder is still credited from the
agent record, and the moment they submit their own write-up for that agent it
replaces the curated one and the badge goes away.

Curated entries are seeded by
[`scripts/seed-spotlight.mjs`](../scripts/seed-spotlight.mjs), which refuses to
attach a write-up to an agent that has since been renamed, made private, or
deleted:

```bash
node scripts/seed-spotlight.mjs           # dry run, reports what would land
node scripts/seed-spotlight.mjs --apply   # write the entries
```

## Verified results

Every entry page carries a **Verified results** block under the headline. The
write-up is the builder's claim; these figures are the opposite, computed by
three.ws on every read from tables the builder cannot type into
([`api/_lib/spotlight-metrics.js`](../api/_lib/spotlight-metrics.js)), each with
the link a reader can check it against:

| Metric | Source | Check it at |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Coins launched | `pump_agent_mints` (mainnet only) | Each coin's `/launches/<mint>` page and its Solscan token page |
| Creator fees | The agent earnings read model behind `GET /api/agents/:id/earnings` (pump.fun creator fees on the agent's own coins) | `/api/agents/<agentId>/earnings` |
| Service income | `agent_revenue_events` (x402 skill sales, USDC net of the platform fee) plus completed `agent_hires`, USDC at 1:1 | `/api/agents/<agentId>/earnings` |
| Activity | Conversations and logged actions, read live off the agent | The facts panel on the entry page |

A metric that is not measured on a deployment says "Not measured yet" and is
left out of `verified.live`; it never renders as a zero. If the metrics read
fails outright, `verified` is `null` and the page says the results could not be
read, while the write-up still loads.

## Success stories

[`/stories`](https://three.ws/stories) shows entries whose agent has a result
worth a story, but only with the agent owner's consent. A story makes claims
about someone's results, and curated entries are written by three.ws without
their builders opting in, so consent is explicit and owner-only:

- **New entry:** tick **Feature this as a success story** on the submit form. It
  is off by default. Unticking it on a later edit withdraws consent.
- **Existing entry (including a curated one):** the agent's owner opens the
  entry page and presses **Feature as a success story**; the same button then
  reads **Withdraw from stories**.
- Consent records who gave it. If the agent changes hands, the old owner's
  consent no longer counts.

A consented entry appears on `/stories` once its agent has at least one
verified result: a coin launched, creator fees above zero, or service income
above zero. Conversations alone never make a story. `/stories` groups the
qualifying entries by category, and each card links to the full entry, the
agent, and every coin on Solscan. Nothing is seeded: when no entry qualifies,
the page says so and tells builders how to get on it.

## Moderation

An admin can hide an entry that breaks the rules and restore it later.
Hiding keeps the row (the builder's words are not destroyed) but drops it from
`/spotlight`, `/stories`, the entry page, the category counts and the share
card, because every public read filters on `status = 'published'`. Each hide and
unhide writes an `audit_log` row (`spotlight_hide` / `spotlight_unhide`) with
the admin, the entry and the reason, and the entry row keeps `hidden_at`,
`hidden_by` and `hidden_reason`.

```bash
curl -s -X POST https://three.ws/api/spotlight/moderate \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' -H "x-csrf-token: $CSRF" -b "$SESSION_COOKIE" \
  -d '{"id":"<entry uuid>","action":"hide","reason":"spam report"}'
```

## Categories

`trading`, `research`, `creative`, `productivity`, `developer`, `social`,
`gaming`, `commerce`, `education`, `other`. The filter rail hides empty
categories, so it shows what the community actually built rather than an
aspirational taxonomy.

## API

Public reads, no key. Writes need a session cookie and a CSRF token, exactly like
every other authenticated three.ws endpoint.

> The endpoints are `/api/spotlight/*`, not `/api/showcase/*`. `/api/showcase` was
> already taken by an unrelated public endpoint, the ERC-8004 agent directory
> behind [`/showcase`](showcase.md). The database tables are still named
> `agent_showcase` and `agent_showcase_votes`, which is deliberate: they are
> applied in production, and renaming a live table to match a module name is not
> a trade worth making.

### `GET /api/spotlight/list`

| Param | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `sort` | `trending` | `trending`, `new`, `top` |
| `category` | none | One of the category slugs above |
| `tag` | none | Single tag |
| `q` | none | Full-text over headline, one-liner, write-up, agent name and description |
| `limit` | `24` | Max 48 |
| `offset` | `0` | Offset pagination |
| `featured` | off | `1` returns only the editor's picks |

```bash
curl -s 'https://three.ws/api/spotlight/list?sort=top&limit=3' | jq '.entries[].title'
```

```json
{
  "entries": [
    {
      "id": "…",
      "title": "A sniper with no language model anywhere in the loop",
      "tagline": "It trades the conviction oracle on a fixed stake…",
      "category": "trading",
      "tags": ["solana", "autonomous", "oracle"],
      "source": "curated",
      "vote_count": 0,
      "voted_by_me": false,
      "trending_score": 1.0,
      "agent": {
        "id": "…",
        "name": "Crosshair",
        "url": "/agents/…",
        "thumbnail": "https://…/thumb/….png",
        "glb_url": "https://…/….glb",
        "chat_count": 2,
        "is_registered": true
      },
      "builder": { "name": "…", "profile_url": null }
    }
  ],
  "total": 14,
  "has_more": false
}
```

A signed-in read is personalised (`voted_by_me`) and returns
`Cache-Control: private, no-store`; an anonymous read is identical for everyone
and is CDN-cached for 30 seconds.

### `GET /api/spotlight/get?id=<uuid>`

One entry, in the same shape, plus a view count bump. This is what
`/spotlight/<id>` renders. `404` once the entry is removed, hidden by a
moderator, or its agent stops being public.

The single-entry read also carries `verified` (see
[Verified results](#verified-results)), plus `story_consent`,
`story_consented_at`, and `owned_by_me` (true only for the agent's owner, who
alone can consent):

```json
{
  "verified": {
    "coins": {
      "count": 2,
      "items": [
        {
          "mint": "…",
          "symbol": "…",
          "launch_url": "/launches/…",
          "solscan_url": "https://solscan.io/token/…"
        }
      ]
    },
    "creator_fees": { "available": true, "sol": 0.0324, "usd": 3.82, "source_url": "/api/agents/…/earnings" },
    "service_income": { "usd": 0, "skill_sales_count": 0, "hires_count": 0, "source_url": "/api/agents/…/earnings" },
    "live": ["coins", "service_income", "creator_fees"],
    "qualifies": true
  }
}
```

### `GET /api/spotlight/stories`

Public. The consented entries whose agent has a verified result, grouped by
category (`groups[].slug`, `groups[].label`, `groups[].entries[]`, each entry
carrying `verified`), plus `total`, `consented` (how many opted in, qualifying
or not) and a plain-language `method`. Cached 60 seconds.

```bash
curl -s https://three.ws/api/spotlight/stories | jq '{total, consented, groups: [.groups[] | {slug, n: (.entries | length)}]}'
```

### `POST /api/spotlight/consent`

Session + CSRF. Body `{ "id": "<entry uuid>", "consent": true }` (or `false` to
withdraw). Only the agent's owner may call it; anyone else gets `403`. Returns
`{ "story_consent": true, "story_consented_at": "…" }`.

### `POST /api/spotlight/moderate`

Admin session + CSRF. Body `{ "id": "<entry uuid>", "action": "hide" | "unhide",
"reason": "optional, up to 280 characters" }`. Returns the entry's new
`status`. `401` signed out, `403` for a non-admin, `404` for an unknown entry.

### `GET /api/spotlight/categories`

Per-category counts plus the headline totals the hero renders
(`{ entries, builders, votes }`).

### `GET /api/spotlight/eligible`

Session required. The caller's public agents that are not already showcased,
plus the category list, which is what the submission form is built from.

### `POST /api/spotlight/submit`

Session + CSRF. Body:

```json
{
  "agentId": "uuid of an agent you own",
  "title": "3 to 90 characters",
  "tagline": "10 to 160 characters",
  "story": "up to 4000 characters, optional",
  "demoUrl": "https://… (http or https only, optional)",
  "category": "trading",
  "tags": ["solana", "autonomous"],
  "featureStory": false
}
```

`featureStory` is story consent (see [Success stories](#success-stories)); only a
literal `true` consents. Returns the created or updated entry. `403` if the agent is not yours, `409` if
it is not public.

### `POST /api/spotlight/vote`

Session + CSRF. Body `{ "id": "<entry uuid>" }`. Toggles, and returns the
server-confirmed state so the button never settles on an optimistic guess:

```json
{ "voted": true, "vote_count": 12 }
```

### `POST /api/spotlight/remove`

Session + CSRF. Body `{ "id": "<entry uuid>" }`. Soft-deletes the entry. Allowed
for the submitter and for the agent's owner. The agent is immediately eligible to
be showcased again.

## Sharing

A crawler that requests `/spotlight/<id>` is rewritten to
[`api/spotlight-og.js`](../api/spotlight-og.js), which renders the entry's
headline, one-liner and builder credit as OG, Twitter Card and Farcaster Frame
meta, with the agent's own live trading card (`/api/og/agent`) as the image. Real
browsers never touch that route. An unknown or removed entry redirects a crawler
to `/spotlight` rather than unfurling a 404.
