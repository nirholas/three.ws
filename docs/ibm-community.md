# IBM Community: Three.ws User Group post catalog

This is the running catalog of everything published in the [Three.ws User Group](https://community.ibm.com/community/user/groups/community-home?communitykey=e71510cc-d953-408f-9a1c-019f5c0a7016) on IBM Community: every discussion thread, every blog post, who wrote it, when, what it says, and what activity it got. It exists so the team can track the group's content without re-crawling the site. For what the group is, the framing rules that govern what gets posted there, and the wider IBM relationship, read [IBM watsonx & Granite](./ibm.md) first.

Dates marked "approx." are derived from the site's relative timestamps ("17 days ago") on the snapshot date; blog dates come from their URLs and are exact.

## Group snapshot (2026-09-10)

| Metric | Value |
| ------ | ----- |
| Members | 17 |
| Discussion threads | 8 catalogued below; the group header tallies 10 |
| Blog posts | 5 (the fifth is the USC post below, not yet catalogued in full) |
| Library entries | 2 (the attachments on the BOWYER and SperaxOS threads) |
| Upcoming events | 0 |
| Past events | 2 (the in-world meetup, and "Live build: text prompt to embedded 3D agent in 30 minutes") |

The group header counts threads as 10 while the digest viewer lists 8. The
header's tally is the one to distrust: the digest viewer is the per-thread
listing this catalog is built from, and it is explicit about its own total.

The 2026-09-10 figures come from the group home page rather than the digest
viewer, so the thread count is the header's and carries the caveat above.
Re-run the per-thread pass against the digest viewer to confirm it.

## Blog posts

### 1. Welcome to the Three.ws User Group: Building AI Agents With 3D Capabilities

- **Author:** Jessica Swanson
- **Published:** 2026-07-14
- **Activity:** 0 comments, 6 views at snapshot
- **URL:** [community.ibm.com/.../welcome-to-the-threews-user-group-building-ai-agen](https://community.ibm.com/community/user/blogs/jessica-swanson/2026/07/14/welcome-to-the-threews-user-group-building-ai-agen)

The group charter. Introduces the community as a space for people exploring AI avatars, embeddable AI agents, spatial reasoning, and AR experiences driven by language models. Names the four focus areas: generative 3D (text and images to production-ready meshes), spatial reasoning (how LLMs understand 3D environments), agentic pipelines (multi-step workflows where AI generates and refines assets on its own), and real-time interactive AI (animated characters and responsive AR in the browser). Target audience: ML engineers, web and game developers, 3D artists, agent-framework builders, and product developers. Points members at three.ws docs, the free no-key text-to-3D generator, the GitHub repo, npm packages, and X. Promises discussion threads, technical blogs, live build sessions, and a resource library.

### 3. Join the Three.ws User Group's First In-World Meetup

Jessica's companion piece to the meetup thread, written in her own voice as a member telling the group not to mistake the event for another webinar link. Carries the event table (Friday, August 7, 8 to 9 AM Pacific, 11 AM Eastern, free, browser only), the three-step join flow (open three.ws/play, bring a custom avatar made at three.ws/create beforehand, talk via spatial voice), and the agenda: live in-world platform tour, community demos, open Q&A ("the skeptical questions are the most useful ones"), and a first look at what is next. Her framing argument: the venue is the demo, so the hour doubles as hands-on evaluation of the technology the group exists to discuss, and since every world is a shareable URL, attending teaches you how to run your own events there. Points readers at the pinned meetup thread for the deep technical background and closes with the full platform link list. The draft lives in [ibm-community-blog-meetup-jessica.md](./ibm-community-blog-meetup-jessica.md).

### 4. The First Three.ws User Group Meetup: How It Actually Went

- **Author:** Jessica Swanson

- **URL:** [community.ibm.com/.../the-first-threews-user-group-meetup-ibm](https://community.ibm.com/community/user/blogs/jessica-swanson/2026/08/08/the-first-threews-user-group-meetup-ibm)

Jessica's close of the meetup arc, written the day after the live post she
published mid-event. She frames the group as an unusual case (three.ws is the
only project she knows of with its own dedicated IBM Community user group, which
exists because IBM's own account had traded posts with three.ws on X before the
group launched), then makes the argument the day proved: a nine-hour user-group
meetup held entirely inside a 3D world instead of on a call is exactly the kind
of thing neither side is supposed to try, and it held up. She reports peak
concurrency of 3,145 avatars in the world across the day, noting the world was
open to anyone with the link, so most of that crowd was not group members. The
agenda ran as planned (in-world platform tour, community demos, open Q&A
including the two open-source watsonx.ai and Granite connectors), but the part
she leads with is what happened around it: fishing, cooking the catch, and
driving cars around the map with two other players. The Q&A recap covers the
Forge, Avatar Studio's auto-rigging, the no-allowlist skeleton mapping across
Mixamo/VRM/Daz/Blender rigs, the cross-world wardrobe, and the `agent-3d` web
component. Her under-the-hood section describes the authoritative server, spatial
voice gated by distance, the clock-derived countdown and fireworks, and the
Meetup Laurel as the platform's answer to "prove you were there". She says
plainly that she was not into crypto before this partnership and that three.ws
changed it. Closes on the follow-through: turning the meetup into a rhythm,
more joint posts, more three.ws work surfaced through IBM channels, and an
explicitly unconfirmed note that three.ws is looking at IBM's newly expanded
Partner Plus marketplace motions (Microsoft Multiparty Private Offers and Google
Cloud Marketplace Channel Private Offers, on top of the live AWS reseller
integration). Links the team's own recap at
[/blog/ibm-user-group-first-in-world-meetup-recap](/blog/ibm-user-group-first-in-world-meetup-recap).

Two placeholders are still live in the published post: a bracketed note about the
next meetup date and a bracketed "[link once available]" for the recording. If
either gets filled in, update this entry.

### 5. Empowering the On-Chain Agent Economy: How three.ws, the University of Southern California, and IBM are ...

- **Author:** not captured
- **Published:** not captured (listed as a featured blog on the group home page on 2026-09-10)
- **Activity:** not captured
- **URL:** not captured

Partial entry. The title is truncated on the group home page and the post was
not opened when this snapshot was taken, so only the visible teaser is recorded:
it opens on the argument that the AI conversation has been dominated by text
boxes, static chatbot interfaces, and single-turn query responses, and that the
next phase is something else. Open the post, then replace this entry with the
same fields the four above carry (author, exact date, activity, URL, faithful
summary). Note for whoever does: the title names IBM alongside three.ws and a
university, so check it against the framing rules in [ibm.md](./ibm.md) and flag
anything that reads as an IBM partnership deliverable.

### 1. Community Meetup Inside three.ws: Join Us on the $THREE Server at three.ws/play

- **Author:** nich (nich8)
- **Posted:** 2026-08-05
- **Activity:** 1 reply (Jessica Swanson, whose profile lists Operational Decision Manager, AI & Data Science at IBM, 2026-08-05: links her blog post "Join the Three.ws User Group's First In-World Meetup")
- **URL:** [community.ibm.com/.../community-meetup-inside-threews-join-us-on-the-three-server-at-threewsplay](https://community.ibm.com/community/user/discussion/community-meetup-inside-threews-join-us-on-the-three-server-at-threewsplay)

The announcement for the group's first community meetup: Friday, August 7, 2026, 8 to 9 AM Pacific (11 AM Eastern), held inside the platform itself in the $THREE home town at three.ws/play rather than on a video call. Free, browser-only, no download or account. Agenda: a live tour from inside the world, community demos, open Q&A, and a first look at what is next. Explains the three-step join flow (open /play, pick or bring an avatar, walk up and talk via spatial voice chat), then makes the venue case: every world is a URL, every pump.fun coin already has a world derived from its mint, and worlds persist, so any community can run its own meetup the same way. The back half is the long read: a surface-by-surface platform tour (creation, distribution, agent economy, developer platform including the two IBM-specific MCP servers), the technology stack (Three.js/Rapier frontend, GPU worker fleet on Cloud Run, authoritative Colyseus multiplayer at 15 Hz, Solana as home chain), the roadmap led by event infrastructure for /play, and a seven-point growth thesis explicitly framed as a thesis, not a promise. The draft lives in [ibm-community-thread.md](./ibm-community-thread.md).

### 2. Community Friday August 7,2026 - Inside three.ws: Join Us on the $THREE Server at three.ws/play

The compact event-card companion to the pinned announcement above: the same Friday, August 7 meetup restated for members who just need the when and the how. Carries the full time-zone line (8 AM San Francisco, 11 AM New York, 4 PM London, 5 PM Berlin, 8:30 PM Mumbai, 11 PM Singapore/Hong Kong, midnight Tokyo), the agenda (live in-world tour, community demos, open Q&A, a first look at what is next), a note that early arrivals get avatar orientation help at the spawn point, and a short platform overview: browser-native multiplayer with spatial voice chat, persistent building, and an integrated economy, on a Three.js and Colyseus stack with Solana and Vertex AI behind it. The draft is the event page description in [ibm-community-meetup-play.html](./ibm-community-meetup-play.html).

### 3. Suggestion for the three.ws team: BOWYER is already using three.ws. Turn it into a real partnership.

A community member reports that BOWYER, a paid marketplace for autonomous AI agents, already uses three.ws in production: every agent listed there gets a rigged 3D avatar from three.ws instead of a static image (their "Whale Hunter" crypto-monitoring agent, $49/month, is the live example). Both platforms are MCP-native: BOWYER exposes agents as MCP servers, three.ws provides `create-3d-avatar`, `generate-3d-model`, and `rig-a-model`. The poster suggests four actions: direct outreach, a "three.ws Inside" co-marketing angle, agent-type avatar templates (trading, research, security presets), and an end-to-end walkthrough. Memorable line: "an agent that earns money and has a face is a product, and an agent that only does one is a demo." Links bowyer.app and a GitHub repo.

### 4. Welcome to the three.ws IBM community: a full tour of the platform (start here)

- **Author:** Jessica Swanson

The orientation thread, posted the same day as the charter blog. Walks the platform surface by surface: free no-account text-to-3D at three.ws/forge, auto-rigging and animation for humanoid models, iterative refinement through dialogue and material editing, scene composition at three.ws/diorama, web-component embedding, AR at three.ws/ar, MCP integration with Claude and ChatGPT, and the multiplayer worlds at three.ws/play and three.ws/agora. Closes with the developer resources (docs, free 3D and crypto-data APIs, MCP servers, npm packages, optional on-chain capabilities) and an invitation to share projects and ask questions.

### 5. From a text prompt to an embeddable 3D agent, step by step

An end-to-end tutorial in four steps: (1) POST a text prompt to `https://three.ws/api/3d/generate` and get back a GLB plus a shareable viewer link (free tier: draft fidelity, single-subject prompts); (2) open any generated model in AR via `https://three.ws/api/ar?src=<url>`, with automatic USDZ conversion for iOS and ARCore for Android; (3) auto-rig humanoid models and assemble an agent in the three.ws/start wizard (personality, voice, optional skills, no code); (4) embed with the two-line `<agent-3d>` element, which supports keyboard navigation and a JavaScript API. Notes the same capabilities are exposed over MCP to Claude, ChatGPT, and other frameworks, and stresses "no account, no API key, and no cost for the generation step." Points readers to three.ws/forge and three.ws/docs.

### 6. SperaxOS × three.ws: Give Your AI Agents a Real 3D Body Inside Sperax Chat

Announces the SperaxOS integration: three.ws agents get fully rigged, animated 3D avatars living directly inside SperaxOS chat, speaking, gesturing, emoting, and reacting to on-chain events in real time (waving, nodding, celebrating a yield target, showing concern near liquidation). Four LLM-callable tools power it: `render_agent`, `speak`, `gesture`, and `emote`. Quick start: add the custom plugin from `https://three.ws/.well-known/sperax-plugin.json` on chat.sperax.io, paste a three.ws Agent ID, and the avatar instantiates with free launch AI credits applied. Framed as making agents more usable inside DeFi workflows; ends with a call to share creations.

### 7. Why does my GLB model load white or untextured? (Three.js, Blender exports, web viewers)

The group's first pure troubleshooting thread, and the most SEO-shaped one. Covers the five causes of a GLB rendering as a flat white or black shape: (1) no lighting or environment map (PBR materials need `scene.environment`, set up via Three.js `PMREMGenerator` or an HDRI); (2) textures not embedded (a `.gltf` with external texture references breaks when moved; export "glTF Binary (.glb)" from Blender); (3) compressed assets without their decoders (`KTX2Loader` for KTX2/Basis, `DRACOLoader` for Draco); (4) CORS blocking cross-origin texture requests; (5) material extensions the viewer does not support, like `KHR_materials_unlit` in older viewers. Ends with an offer to debug files or screenshots posted in the thread.

### 8. Type a Sentence, Get a 3D Model: A Hands-On Walkthrough of the three.ws Forge | User Perspective

A first-run walkthrough of the Forge from a user's perspective, no account, wallet, or API key required. The flow: open three.ws/forge, describe a single object with explicit materials ("a glazed ceramic teapot"), pick a quality tier (Draft, about 15 seconds and 12k triangles; Standard, about 1 minute and 30k; High, about 2 minutes and 200k), generate, preview in the live viewer, then download the GLB for Blender, Unity, Unreal, or three.js, or open it in AR on a phone. Prompt advice: one object per prompt, name the materials, skip scenes and backgrounds. The developer section covers the keyless HTTP API and the MCP server, and links the text-to-3D tutorial, prompt recipes, the image-to-3D guide, and the HTTP API docs. Invites readers to share results and prompts.

## Drafts written, not yet posted

| Draft | Subject |
|---|---|
| [ibm-community-governed-agents-post.md](./ibm-community-governed-agents-post.md) | Granite Guardian as an action veto once agents can control a home, ride in a car, and order a manufactured object; the watsonx.ai surface map; the quarter's shipping recap; and the group's next event question |
| [ibm-community-defi-3d-sperax.md](./ibm-community-defi-3d-sperax.md) | Written for Jessica to publish in her own voice. Section 0 answers "why is an IBM employee writing about two crypto companies" as her own practitioner case (her field is decision integrity, this is the best material on it she has read) rather than as IBM partnership strategy, which she does not own. Then the triangle of three relationships (Sperax with three.ws, both as IBM Business Partners, and the three.ws runtime on Granite through watsonx.ai) split as body / DeFi domain / brain, with an explicit subsection denying that IBM commissioned or endorsed the integration itself, and framed through her decision-management day job. Section 1 makes DeFi a real subject rather than a backdrop (the four properties that break a chat box, the tool catalog, the approve-before-acting execution model): the two ways to embed an embodied agent in a host application (standalone manifest vs native component), the continuous emotion blend that replaced a state machine, why grounding the avatar in verified reads mattered more than the rendering, honest failure when a probe is bot-challenged, the hash-chained action ledger, the code that moved in both directions, what is planned, and AR flagged as the next surface rather than a shipped one. Carries four diagrams rendered by [scripts/render-ibm-sperax-diagrams.mjs](../scripts/render-ibm-sperax-diagrams.mjs) into [media/](./media), plus [ibm-community-defi-3d-sperax-post.md](./ibm-community-defi-3d-sperax-post.md) and its styled `-post.html` twin, both generated by [scripts/build-ibm-community-post.mjs](../scripts/build-ibm-community-post.mjs) with the frontmatter and editor notes stripped. Edit the draft, never the generated trio. Form values, the permalink slug, the meta description, and the image-placement sequence are in [ibm-community-defi-3d-sperax-publishing-kit.md](./ibm-community-defi-3d-sperax-publishing-kit.md). **Open question before posting:** the draft states that Sperax is also an IBM Business Partner, which came from the owner and is not evidenced anywhere in this repo; confirm the wording Sperax uses for its own partner status first |

Both drafts carry the framing rules from [ibm.md](./ibm.md) in their frontmatter, including which section to cut first if the group's no-crypto-cluster rule is applied strictly.
