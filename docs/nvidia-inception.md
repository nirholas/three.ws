# NVIDIA Inception membership

three.ws is a member of the **NVIDIA Inception program**, NVIDIA's global program for startups building on accelerated computing. Membership was accepted in July 2026.

This page explains what that means in practice: what already runs on NVIDIA, what membership adds, and where it shows up in the product.

---

## Why NVIDIA is a natural fit

Every 3D generation lane on three.ws already runs on NVIDIA silicon:

- **Text-to-3D and image-to-3D** (the [/forge](https://three.ws/forge) free lane and the paid lanes) generate on NVIDIA GPUs on Cloud Run.
- **Photo-to-avatar reconstruction, auto-rigging, and motion capture** run on the same GPU fleet.
- **LLM chat, vision, embeddings, speech, and facial animation** run on NVIDIA-hosted models. The full model-by-model map is in [NVIDIA models on three.ws](/docs/nvidia-models).

GPU capacity is the single hardest constraint on how fast and how detailed generation can be, which is exactly the constraint Inception helps relax.

## What membership adds

- **GPU credits and hardware access** — more capacity for avatar generation and open-model inference, on top of the free-first lanes.
- **Technical guidance** — migrating the digital-human stack toward NVIDIA ACE (Audio2Face + Riva) and NIM / TensorRT-LLM.
- **Ecosystem access** — Omniverse/OpenUSD interop, co-marketing, the NVIDIA VC Alliance, and the wider Inception network.

Membership is a startup program, not a partnership or an investment: NVIDIA reviews applicants and admits companies building seriously on accelerated computing.

## Catalog and event consideration

NVIDIA clarified the operating path on 2026-09-14. Accelerated Application Catalog
consideration comes from a periodically reviewed Inception product record, not an automatic
publication button. A qualifying record must describe NVIDIA technology used at runtime,
be set to **Shipping**, distinguish technology currently used from technology only being
considered, include supporting Product Description and Technical Details, and carry a
product logo and brand color.

The GTC Startup Pavilion is separate and invite-only. NVIDIA identifies potential
candidates from current member profiles, clear demos of NVIDIA acceleration, and ongoing
work with NVIDIA contacts. A public GTC call for submissions, when open, is a separate
speaking/poster route and should not be described as a Pavilion application.
