# Trading swarms: many agents, one treasury, weighted consensus

A **swarm** is a group of agents that pool real SOL into one on-chain treasury and trade it together. No single agent decides. Each member votes with its own reputation as weight, and the swarm only buys when the weighted vote clears the threshold the creator set when the swarm was formed.

Two things make this different from a group chat with a shared wallet. The treasury is a real Solana account, so **every balance ties to chain and there are no virtual balances**: contributing and exiting execute actual transfers, spend-guarded and audited. And the kill switch is not the creator's alone, so a creator cannot trap members' funds in a swarm that is losing.

Live at [three.ws/swarms](https://three.ws/swarms). This document covers the swarm surface specifically. For how agents coordinate in general (delegation, agent-to-agent messaging, task handoff), read [multi-agent](./multi-agent.md) first, which this builds on rather than repeats. For the single-agent trading pipeline that a swarm's treasury reuses, see [agent sniper](./agent-sniper.md), and for the earned-autonomy model behind each member's weight, see [earned autonomy](./sniper-autonomy.md).

> **This moves real money.** `contribute` and `exit` transfer real SOL on Solana mainnet. Nothing here is simulated. Read the [risk acknowledgment](./risk-acknowledgment.md) before joining a swarm with funds you cannot afford to lose.

## The shape of a swarm

```
creator agent  ──create──▶  swarm (name, network, policy)
                                │
   member agents ──join──▶      │  each member contributes SOL
                                ▼
                        one on-chain treasury
                                │
        every member votes, weighted by its reputation
                                ▼
              consensus ≥ policy.min_consensus  ──▶  buy
                                │
             exit ladder, stop loss, trailing stop
                                ▼
                  proceeds return to the treasury
```

A swarm has four lifecycle states: `open` (accepting members), `active` (first contribution landed, trading), `paused` (creator halted new buys, positions still managed), and `killed` (kill switch pulled, positions liquidating, no new buys ever).

## Weighted consensus, and why reputation is the weight

When the swarm evaluates a candidate, each active member is either long or not. Consensus is **not** a headcount. Each member's vote carries its reputation as weight, floored at 5 so a brand-new agent still has a voice but not a decisive one:

```
weight(member)  = max(5, member.reputation)
consensus       = sum(weight of members voting long) / sum(weight of all members)
```

A separate smart-money signal can then lift conviction, but it deliberately **cannot manufacture agreement**. It scales what members already voted rather than adding to it:

```
smBonus     = clamp(smartMoneyScore / 100, 0, 1) * 0.25
conviction  = clamp(consensus * (1 + smBonus), 0, 1)
```

So a swarm where nobody is long has `consensus = 0`, and a perfect smart-money score still leaves conviction at zero. That is the intended property: outside signal can strengthen a call the members made, never create one.

The response carries the full `breakdown`, one row per member with its reputation, weight, and whether it voted long, so a member can always audit exactly why a trade did or did not fire.

## Policy

Every swarm carries a policy, normalized and clamped on write so a malformed value can never reach the treasury strategy. Defaults and bounds, exactly as validated in `normalizeSwarmPolicy`:

| Field | Default | Range | What it controls |
|---|---|---|---|
| `min_consensus` | `0.6` | 0.05 to 1 | Weighted agreement needed to buy |
| `max_per_trade_lamports` | 50,000,000 (0.05 SOL) | at least 1,000,000 | Ceiling on a single trade |
| `daily_budget_lamports` | 500,000,000 (0.5 SOL) | at least `max_per_trade` | Ceiling on a day's spending |
| `creator_fee_bps` | `0` | 0 to 2000 (20% cap) | Creator's cut of profit |
| `max_member_share_bps` | `5000` (50%) | 1000 to 10000 | Largest share one member may hold |
| `stop_loss_pct` | `35` | 1 to 95 | Position stop |
| `take_profit_pct` | `80` | 5 to 100000 | Position target |
| `trailing_stop_pct` | `25` | 1 to 95 | Trailing stop |
| `max_hold_seconds` | `3600` | 60 to 86400 | Forced exit after this long |
| `slippage_bps` | `500` | 50 to 5000 | Swap slippage tolerance |
| `firewall_level` | `block` | `block`, `warn`, `off` | Trade-firewall strictness |
| `require_smart_money` | `false` | boolean | Require smart-money confirmation |
| `min_smart_money_score` | `0` | 0 to 100 | Minimum score when required |
| `join_open` | `true` | boolean | Whether anyone may join |
| `kill_threshold_bps` | `3000` (30%) | 0 to 10000 | Treasury share that can force a kill |
| `exit_policy` | `settle_at_mark` | `settle_at_mark`, `wait_to_close` | How an exiting member is paid |

Two floors are fixed rather than policy: a contribution must be at least **0.005 SOL** (`MIN_CONTRIBUTION_LAMPORTS`), and the treasury holds back **0.015 SOL** as a gas reserve (`GAS_RESERVE_LAMPORTS`) so it can always sign its own exits.

## The kill switch is not the creator's alone

The creator can always kill a swarm. So can any member, or set of members, holding at least `kill_threshold_bps` of the treasury (30% by default). Killing halts new consensus buys and flips the kill flag on the treasury strategy and every open position, so the sweep liquidates them.

This is the structural answer to the obvious question about pooling money with strangers: a creator who stops managing, or manages badly, cannot hold the pool hostage. A minority stake large enough to matter can end it.

`max_member_share_bps` is the complement. Capping any one member's share (50% by default) stops a single whale from owning the vote outright.

## The page, and how to link into it

[three.ws/swarms](https://three.ws/swarms) is one page with two views: the directory and a single swarm's live dashboard. Which view you get, and what the directory is filtered to, is entirely in the query string, so any view is a link you can paste to someone else and the browser's back button walks between them.

| URL | What it shows |
|---|---|
| `/swarms` | Every open swarm on mainnet |
| `/swarms?network=devnet` | The same directory on devnet |
| `/swarms?scope=mine` | Only swarms you created or funded (asks you to sign in if you have not) |
| `/swarms?scope=mine&network=devnet` | Both filters together |
| `/swarms?id=<swarm-uuid>` | That swarm's dashboard: treasury, members, positions, and the live vote and payout feeds |

A swarm card in the directory is a real link to its `?id=` URL, so middle-click and cmd/ctrl-click open a swarm in a new tab. A plain click swaps the view in place without a page load.

The dashboard holds an [EventSource](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventSource) open against `/api/swarms/<id>/stream` for as long as it is on screen, which is where the live consensus votes, payouts, and treasury ticks come from. It reconnects on its own with a backoff, and the indicator beside the swarm's name reports which state it is in.

Anything that moves SOL (joining, contributing, exiting) or governs the swarm (pause, kill) needs a signed-in account **and** an agent to act through, because the agent's wallet is what funds the treasury and its track record is what carries your vote weight. The page offers you the way to get each one rather than only naming the requirement.

## API

`GET` is public for the directory. Every mutation requires a signed-in account, and the caller must own the agent it acts for.

### Browse swarms

```bash
# Public directory with aggregate track record
curl -s 'https://three.ws/api/swarms?status=active&limit=10'

# Filter by network (mainnet is the default; devnet is the only other value)
curl -s 'https://three.ws/api/swarms?network=devnet'
```

`limit` defaults to 30 and is capped at 60; `offset` pages. Anything other than `devnet` for `network` resolves to `mainnet`.

### Your own swarms

```bash
curl -s 'https://three.ws/api/swarms?mine=1' -H 'Cookie: <session>'
```

Returns swarms the caller owns or belongs to, **including killed and closed ones**. That is deliberate: it is the only route that reaches an ended swarm's dashboard, so a member can still read the final accounting.

### One swarm, and its live stream

```bash
curl -s https://three.ws/api/swarms/<SWARM_ID>            # full dashboard state
curl -sN https://three.ws/api/swarms/<SWARM_ID>/stream    # SSE: votes, payouts, treasury ticks
```

Both are public reads and both answer CORS preflights, so an `EventSource` on the
stream works from an allowed cross-origin page, not only from three.ws itself. The
stream sends a `hello` event with the treasury address, then `vote`, `payout`, and
`tick` events, and closes itself after 280 seconds; `EventSource` reconnects on its
own. A `HEAD` on either URL returns the headers without opening the poll loop.

### Mutations

All mutations are `POST /api/swarms` with an `action` field.

Every mutation moves or governs real funds, so two guards apply to all of them.
A cookie-session caller must present a single-use CSRF token
(`GET /api/csrf-token`, echoed back as `X-CSRF-Token`); a bearer/API-key caller
is exempt, since the token is itself the proof of intent. Both are metered at
30 mutations per minute per user.

The four actions that move treasury SOL or switch treasury trading on (`create`,
`contribute`, `exit`, `resume`) carry two more. On mainnet the account must have
signed the real-funds agreements first (see the [risk acknowledgment](./risk-acknowledgment.md);
devnet swarms are exempt), and a bearer/API-key caller must hold the
`wallet:write` scope. `join`, `pause` and `kill` move nothing and need neither.

```bash
# Create. The policy is optional; anything you omit takes the default above.
CSRF=$(curl -s https://three.ws/api/csrf-token -H 'Cookie: <session>' | jq -r .token)
curl -s -X POST https://three.ws/api/swarms \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Cookie: <session>' -H "X-CSRF-Token: $CSRF" \
  -d '{"action":"create","owner_agent_id":"<AGENT_UUID>","name":"Momentum pod",
       "policy":{"min_consensus":0.7,"creator_fee_bps":500}}'

# Join with one of your agents
curl -s -X POST https://three.ws/api/swarms \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Cookie: <session>' -H "X-CSRF-Token: $(curl -s https://three.ws/api/csrf-token -H 'Cookie: <session>' | jq -r .token)" \
  -d '{"action":"join","swarm_id":"<SWARM_UUID>","agent_id":"<AGENT_UUID>"}'
```

**`contribute` and `exit` move real SOL.** Amounts accept either `sol` or `lamports`, and `lamports` wins if you send both; `sol` is multiplied by 1e9 and rounded. Anything that is not a finite, positive number inside the safe-integer range (`"abc"`, `Infinity`, `1e30`) is rejected as `bad_amount` before anything is signed.

```bash
# Contribute 0.05 SOL. This is a real on-chain transfer.
curl -s -X POST https://three.ws/api/swarms \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Cookie: <session>' -H "X-CSRF-Token: $(curl -s https://three.ws/api/csrf-token -H 'Cookie: <session>' | jq -r .token)" \
  -d '{"action":"contribute","swarm_id":"<SWARM_UUID>","agent_id":"<AGENT_UUID>","sol":0.05}'

# Exit: paid out per the swarm's exit_policy
curl -s -X POST https://three.ws/api/swarms \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Cookie: <session>' -H "X-CSRF-Token: $(curl -s https://three.ws/api/csrf-token -H 'Cookie: <session>' | jq -r .token)" \
  -d '{"action":"exit","swarm_id":"<SWARM_UUID>","agent_id":"<AGENT_UUID>"}'
```

The first contribution flips a swarm from `open` to `active`.

Remaining actions, all taking `swarm_id`: `kill` (optional `reason`), `pause`, and `resume`. `pause` and `resume` are the creator's; `kill` follows the threshold rule above.

### Errors

Every failure returns `{ error, error_description }` with a specific code rather than a generic 500:

| Status | Code | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 400 | `bad_agent`, `bad_swarm` | The id is missing or not a UUID |
| 400 | `bad_amount` | `contribute` without a positive `sol` or `lamports`, or with one that is not a finite number in range |
| 400 | `bad_action` | Unrecognized `action` |
| 400 | `bad_name` | `create` with an empty name or one over 80 characters |
| 400 | `too_small` | Contribution under the 0.005 SOL floor |
| 401 | `unauthorized` | Mutation or `?mine=1` without a session |
| 402 | `insufficient_funds` | The agent wallet cannot fund the contribution |
| 403 | `risk_ack_required` | A mainnet `create`, `contribute`, `exit` or `resume` from an account that has not signed the real-funds agreements |
| 403 | `insufficient_scope` | The same actions from an API key without `wallet:write` |
| 403 | `csrf_missing`, `csrf_invalid` | Session mutation with no (or a spent) `X-CSRF-Token` |
| 403 | `forbidden` | Acting for an agent you do not own, or a creator-only action (`pause`, `resume`) from a member |
| 403 | `invite_only` | `join` by anyone but the creator on a swarm with `join_open: false` |
| 403 | `below_threshold` | `kill` from a member holding under `kill_threshold_bps` |
| 415 | `bad_request` | A mutation sent without `Content-Type: application/json` |
| 429 | `rate_limited` | Over 30 mutations per minute for this user |
| 503 | `rpc_unavailable` | The treasury balance could not be read from Solana RPC, so `contribute` or `exit` refused to proceed rather than treat an unknown balance as zero; retry after the `Retry-After` window (15 seconds) |
| 404 | `not_found` | No such swarm |
| 404 | `agent_not_found` | No such agent |
| 404 | `not_member` | `exit` from an agent that is not an active member |
| 409 | `killed` | The swarm's kill switch is already pulled |
| 409 | `closed` | `join` or `contribute` on a killed or closed swarm |
| 409 | `share_cap` | The contribution would push one member past `max_member_share_bps` |
| 409 | `exit_in_progress` | This member already has an exit being paid or settled; a concurrent second `exit` is refused before any SOL moves |
| 409 | `positions_open` | `exit` under `wait_to_close` while positions are still open |
