# Account & Dashboard

UX Flow Atlas — cluster 11. Traced end-to-end against real source in `/workspaces/three.ws`.

## Routing summary

Resolved from `vercel.json` (`routes`) and `vite.config.js` (`vercel-rewrites` dev middleware):

| Route | Resolves to | Page module(s) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/login` | `public/login.html` | inline JS + `public/wallet-login.js` + `src/privy-login.js` |
| `/register` | `public/register.html` | inline JS + `public/wallet-login.js` + `src/privy-login.js` |
| `/forgot-password` | `public/forgot-password.html` | inline JS |
| `/reset-password` | `public/reset-password.html` | inline JS (atlas-adjacent; documented as the completion of forgot-password) |
| `/dashboard` | `pages/dashboard-next/index.html` | `src/dashboard-next/pages/home.js` |
| `/dashboard/account` | `pages/dashboard-next/account.html` | `src/dashboard-next/pages/account.js` |
| `/dashboard/settings` | `pages/dashboard-next/settings.html` | `src/dashboard-next/pages/settings.js` |
| `/settings` | `public/settings/index.html` | inline module script |

`/login` and `/register` are **dedicated full pages, not modals**. Both share the same auth backend (`/api/auth/*`), the same Privy module (`src/privy-login.js`), and the same wallet-button loader (`public/wallet-login.js`). The shared client helpers live in `src/auth/email-auth.js` (`signInWithEmail`, `registerWithEmail`, `getCurrentUser`, `signOut`, `requireAuth`).

Shared auth concepts:
- **Session:** a `__Host-sid` cookie minted server-side by `createSession()`, identical across email/password, SIWE (EVM), SIWS (Solana), Privy, and SAML.
- **Account linking by email:** a Privy or SAML sign-in that carries an email joins the existing account with that address only when the platform has itself verified it (`users.email_verified`). An unverified match is left alone and the identity gets its own new account (Privy falls back to a `privy-<did>@privy.local` address), so pre-registering someone else's email cannot capture their later sign-in.
- **Post-auth redirect:** `?next=` query param → `sessionStorage.login_redirect` → default (`/dashboard` for login, `/create` for register). On `/login`, an already-authenticated visitor is bounced to `next` via a `GET /api/auth/me` probe on load. The value is sanitized by a shared `safeNext` helper: anything that is not a single-leading-slash same-site path (protocol-relative `//host`, backslashes, control characters) is silently discarded and the default is used, so a crafted external `?next=` can no longer navigate off-site. The Privy email and wallet paths (`src/privy-login.js`) run their `next` through the same helper.
- **Auth hint:** every successful auth writes `localStorage['3dagent:auth-hint']` so other surfaces render a logged-in chrome optimistically.
- **Terms clickwrap (ToS v3):** every auth surface asserts Terms acceptance. `/register` has a required checkbox; `/login` and the Privy/wallet paths use notice-style clickwrap ("By signing in... you agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy") and send `tosAccepted: true`; the Privy SIWE message statement itself carries the agreement text. The server records `users.tos_accepted_version`/`tos_accepted_at` plus an append-only `audit_log` row (`api/_lib/legal.js`, `TOS_VERSION = 3`) and re-stamps on login.
- **Real-funds agreements (separate from sign-up):** signing up does not unlock money movement. Before a real-funds action (an armed sniper or Oracle watch, a custodial agent purchase, an x402 payment, a withdrawal) and before an agent wallet's deposit address is revealed, the account must separately sign three documents together at `/legal/agreements`: the Terms of Service (`/legal/tos`), the Risk Disclosure (`/legal/risk`), and the Agent Wallet Agreement (`/legal/agent-wallet`). Signatures are typed-name e-signatures recorded append-only in `legal_signatures`; the dialog is `public/risk-ack.js` posting to `/api/legal/risk-ack`, and every money-moving endpoint enforces it server-side through `requireRealFundsAgreement()` (`api/_lib/real-funds-agreement.js`), answering `403 risk_ack_required` over session and API key alike. Devnet is exempt. See [risk-acknowledgment.md](../risk-acknowledgment.md).

### Sign in — `/login`
- **Source:** `public/login.html` (inline `<script>` for email/password + already-auth guard), `public/wallet-login.js` (EVM SIWE + Solana SIWS connect buttons in the on-chain drawer), `src/privy-login.js` (Privy email-OTP + Privy SIWE/SIWS; it also imports `solana-mobile/src/index.js`, which boots the Seed Vault / Mobile Wallet Adapter wallet inside the Seeker Android app and is a no-op everywhere else), `src/auth/email-auth.js` (shared helpers).
- **Entry point:** Direct nav to `/login`; from "Sign in" links in nav/footer; via `requireAuth()` / `requireUser()` redirects (`/login?return=…` or `?next=…`) from any gated page.
- **Prerequisites / gates:** None to view. An existing account is required for the email/password path; wallet paths can sign in an existing wallet-linked user. If `GET /api/auth/me` resolves with a user on load, the page `location.replace(next)` immediately (skipped on back/forward navigation).
- **Steps (N):**
  1. Page loads; theme boot script applies dark/light; nav injected from `/nav.js`; login avatar (`@three-ws/agent-ui`) renders on the side panel.
  2. On load, fire `GET /api/auth/me` (credentials included). If `{user}` → `location.replace(next)` (already signed in). If 401 → stay on form. If transport error → show "Couldn't verify your session…" notice but keep form usable.
  3. (optional) Email is prefilled from `?email=` or `localStorage['3dagent:last-email']`; if present, focus jumps to password.
  4. **Email/password path:** type email-or-username into `#email`, password into `#password`. Avatar covers its eyes while a credential field is focused. (optional) toggle show/hide password; Caps-Lock warning shows live.
  5. (optional) tick "Remember me".
  6. Click **Sign in** (`#submit`). Client validates both fields are non-empty (inline field errors + avatar facepalm on empty).
  7. `POST /api/auth/login` with `{ email, password, remember, tosAccepted: true }` (notice-style clickwrap; the legal line sits under the form), credentials included. Button shows "Signing in…".
  8. On `!res.ok`: 429 → "Too many attempts…", else "Email or password is incorrect." — inline error on password field, avatar facepalm, button re-enabled.
  9. On success: persist `3dagent:last-email` + auth-hint; button "Signed in — redirecting…"; avatar plays a dance; after one dance cycle (700–1800ms) `location.replace(next)`.
  10. **(optional) Privy email-OTP path:** type email in `#privy-email-input` → click **Send code**. The Privy app's CAPTCHA config is read first (`src/auth/privy-captcha.js`, 6 s timeout): when one is required a Cloudflare Turnstile challenge resolves before the request, and when the config cannot be read the step stops with "We could not reach the sign-in service to check whether this step needs a CAPTCHA…" rather than sending a token-less request that Privy would reject as `invalid_credentials`. `privy.auth.email.sendCode()` sends the code; UI advances to the code step. The same check runs before the Privy EVM wallet path.
  11. Enter the 6-digit code → **Verify** → `privy.auth.email.loginWithCode()` returns an `identity_token` → `POST /api/auth/privy/verify` mints the session → `location.href = next`. (optional **← Back** returns to email step.)
  12. **(optional) Privy EVM wallet:** click the **EVM** chain button → `eth_requestAccounts` → `privy.auth.siwe.init()` builds the message → `personal_sign` in wallet → `privy.auth.siwe.loginWithSiwe(signature)` → `POST /api/auth/privy/verify` → redirect. Status text walks through "Requesting accounts… / Generating message… / Sign… / Signing in…".
  13. **(optional) Privy Solana wallet:** click the **Solana** chain button → `provider.connect()` (Phantom/Backpack/Solflare) → `GET /api/auth/siws/nonce` → build SIWS message → `provider.signMessage` → `POST /api/auth/siws/verify` (with `x-csrf-token`) → redirect.
  14. **(optional) On-chain features drawer:** click "Connect wallet" to expand `#onchain-section`; Solana/EVM tabs mount the native connect buttons from `public/wallet-login.js` (full SIWE/SIWS via `/wallet/connect-button*.js`). Drawer state persists in `sessionStorage['login:onchain']`.
  15. **(optional) Enterprise SSO:** if `GET /api/config` returns `samlEnabled`, the **SSO** button reveals and navigates to `/api/auth/saml/login?next=…`.
- **Decision points / branches:** email+password (legacy `/api/auth/login`) **vs** Privy email-OTP (`/api/auth/privy/verify`) **vs** Privy EVM SIWE **vs** Privy Solana SIWS **vs** native on-chain drawer SIWE/SIWS (`wallet-login.js`) **vs** SAML SSO. Solana chain tab auto-disables and falls back to EVM when no Solana provider is detected.
- **External calls / dependencies:** `GET /api/auth/me`, `POST /api/auth/login`, `POST /api/auth/privy/verify`, `GET /api/auth/siws/nonce`, `POST /api/auth/siws/verify`, `GET /api/config`, `/api/auth/saml/login`; Privy JS SDK (`@privy-io/js-sdk-core`, app id from `/api/config`), Cloudflare Turnstile, browser wallet providers (`window.ethereum`, `window.solana`/Phantom/Backpack/Solflare), `@three-ws/agent-ui` (avatar), model-viewer CDN.
- **Success state:** Session cookie set; auth-hint persisted; `location.replace`/`href` to `next` (default `/dashboard`).
- **Empty / error states:** Per-field inline errors with shake + avatar facepalm; transport-failure banner on the session probe; if `GET /api/config` fails or times out (6 s), the Privy email and wallet sections hide behind an inline "Email and wallet sign-in could not load…" notice while the password form stays usable; every Privy and SIWS network call is bounded (10 to 20 s) and a transport failure reads as "Could not reach the sign-in service"; SSO error codes from the URL (`sso_unavailable`, `saml_invalid`, `account_deleted`, `rate_limited`, etc.) and `?signed_out` notice; Privy/wallet errors map "reject/denied/cancel" to "Signature cancelled."; wallet-module load failure shows a connection error; wallet skeleton shimmer while connect buttons mount.
- **Step count:** 9 required (+6 optional)

---

### Create account — `/register`
- **Source:** `public/register.html` (inline JS: username/password submit + already-auth guard + password-strength + on-chain drawer), `src/privy-login.js` (same Privy email-OTP/wallet paths as login), `public/wallet-login.js`, `src/auth/email-auth.js` (`registerWithEmail`).
- **Entry point:** "Create one" link from `/login`; "Create account" / "Sign up" CTAs; gated-flow redirects.
- **Prerequisites / gates:** None. Already-signed-in visitors are bounced to `next` (default `/create`) via the `GET /api/auth/me` guard (skipped on back/forward).
- **Steps (N):**
  1. Page loads; register avatar (`/avatars/cz.glb` model-viewer) renders with mouse-parallax look-around.
  2. On load, `GET /api/auth/me`; if `{user}` → `location.replace(next)`; 401 stays; transport error shows a notice.
  3. Type a **Username** (`#username`, 3–30 chars, `[a-zA-Z0-9_-]`); inline hint validates live ("✓ Looks good" / specific error).
  4. Type a **Password** (`#password`, min 10 chars); strength meter updates (Too short → Very strong); Caps-Lock warning; (optional) show/hide toggle.
  5. Tick the required **Terms checkbox** (`#tos-accept`, "I have read and agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy", linking `/legal/tos` and `/legal/privacy`); native `required` validation blocks submit until ticked.
  6. Click **Create account** (`#submit`); button shows "Creating account…".
  7. `POST /api/auth/register` with `{ username, password, tosAccepted }`, credentials included. The server rejects registration without acceptance (`400 tos_required`).
  8. On `!res.ok`: 429 → "Too many attempts…"; 409 → "That username is taken."; 400 → field guidance (prefers the server's `error_description`, e.g. the `tos_required` copy); 422 → the "isn't allowed" copy with a try-another nudge; 5xx → server-fault copy; network `TypeError` → "Couldn't reach the server…". Error banner shown, button re-enabled.
  9. On success: server creates the account **and an immediate session** (signed in on register); persist auth-hint; `location.replace(next)` (default `/create`).
  10. **(optional) Privy email-OTP / EVM / Solana wallet** registration: identical flows to `/login` (shared `src/privy-login.js`), each asserting `tosAccepted: true`: Send code → Verify, or EVM SIWE, or Solana SIWS → session → redirect.
  11. **(optional) On-chain features drawer**: same Solana/EVM native connect buttons; state persists in `sessionStorage['register:onchain']`.
- **Decision points / branches:** username+password (`/api/auth/register`) **vs** Privy email-OTP **vs** Privy EVM SIWE **vs** Privy Solana SIWS **vs** native on-chain drawer SIWE/SIWS. (Note: the primary form here collects **username** + password, whereas `/login` accepts email-or-username; the shared `registerWithEmail()` helper supports an email+displayName variant used by other surfaces, and only sends `tosAccepted: true` when the calling surface passes it explicitly.)
- **External calls / dependencies:** `GET /api/auth/me`, `POST /api/auth/register`, `POST /api/auth/privy/verify`, `GET /api/auth/siws/nonce`, `POST /api/auth/siws/verify`, `GET /api/config`; Privy SDK, Turnstile, browser wallets, model-viewer CDN.
- **Success state:** Account created, session minted, redirect to `next` (default `/create`); user is logged in.
- **Empty / error states:** Live username/password validation; unticked Terms checkbox blocks submit (and the server 400s with `tos_required` if bypassed); status-mapped error banner (taken username, rate-limit, server fault, offline); Privy/wallet cancellation handling; a second ToS/Privacy legal line below the button covers the Privy/wallet paths.
- **Step count:** 9 required (+2 optional)

---

### Forgot password — `/forgot-password`
- **Source:** `public/forgot-password.html` (inline JS). Completion happens at `/reset-password` (`public/reset-password.html`).
- **Entry point:** "Forgot password?" link in the `/login` remember-row.
- **Prerequisites / gates:** None. Privacy-preserving: never reveals whether an account exists.
- **Steps (N):**
  1. Page loads; avatar look-around; email field focus lights its label.
  2. Type email (`#email`); inline hint validates format live ("✓ Looks valid" / "Enter a valid email address.").
  3. Click **Send reset link** (`#submit`); button shows "Sending…".
  4. `POST /api/auth/forgot-password` with `{ email }`.
  5. Server always answers 200 with a privacy-preserving body. On status `< 500` → show success notice: "If an account exists for that email, a reset link has been sent."; on `>= 500` → error notice "Something went wrong on our end…"; on fetch rejection → "Couldn't reach the server…".
  6. Button re-enabled ("Send reset link") regardless, so the user can retry.
  7. **(completion, separate route) `/reset-password?token=…`:** user clicks the emailed link → `public/reset-password.html` reads `?token`. If no token → error + disabled submit. Enter new password + confirm (both min 10, must match) → **Reset password** → `POST /api/auth/reset-password` with `{ token, password }` → on success swap to "Password reset. You can now log in." with a link back to `/login`; on error show message and re-enable. The server consumes the token in the same statement that checks it, so one link can win only once even under concurrent submits, and a successful reset revokes every session and OAuth refresh token on the account.
- **Decision points / branches:** Single path (email). The reset-completion step is a distinct page reached from email, not a branch within `/forgot-password`.
- **External calls / dependencies:** `POST /api/auth/forgot-password`; (completion) `POST /api/auth/reset-password`; model-viewer CDN.
- **Success state:** Privacy-preserving "reset link sent" notice (request side); on the completion page, "Password reset" confirmation with a sign-in link.
- **Empty / error states:** Inline email-format hint; 5xx error notice; offline/transport error notice; reset page guards a missing/invalid token and enforces match + length.
- **Step count:** 6 required (+1 completion step on a separate route)

---

### Dashboard overview — `/dashboard`
- **Source:** `pages/dashboard-next/index.html` → `src/dashboard-next/pages/home.js`; shell from `src/dashboard-next/shell.js` (sidebar/topbar/drawer/palette); data helpers from `src/dashboard-next/api.js`.
- **Entry point:** Nav/footer "Dashboard" links; post-login redirect default; `getting-started.js` guide.
- **Prerequisites / gates:** **Signed-in required.** `requireUser()` (in `api.js`) calls `getMe()` → `GET /api/auth/me`; on 401 it navigates to `/login?return=<path>` and returns a never-resolving promise so the page halts cleanly. `/dashboard-classic/*` and legacy sub-routes 301 to canonical `/dashboard/*` (vercel.json + dev middleware).
- **Steps (N):**
  1. `home.js` boots → `mountShell()` renders sidebar + topbar + live-event drawer + command palette; the active nav item pulses "you are here".
  2. `requireUser()` resolves the session (or redirects to login).
  3. Greeting renders ("Welcome back, &lt;name&gt;."); new-account detection (< 30 days) and dismissal flags (`twx_onboarding_dismissed`, `twx_forge_announce_dismissed`) decide which banners show. The forge announce is now a full "Text & image to 3D are live" front door: an animated visual, a rotating example-prompt typewriter, and an inline prompt composer that deep-links to `/forge?prompt=…`.
  4. Skeletons render across hero / KPI / activity slots.
  5. Parallel fetch: `GET /api/avatars?limit=50`, `GET /api/widgets`, `GET /api/agents?limit=20` (each `Promise.allSettled`, degrades independently).
  6. Hero strip shows live 3D avatar previews; KPI row (revenue, views, transcripts, avatars) with sparklines over a 7-day window; trading + world-health sections; 2×2 quick-actions grid; agent/avatar directory; recent-activity feed (stitched transcripts + revenue events).
  7. The onboarding guide (`getting-started.js`) is reconciled against authoritative server state (avatars/agents/widgets) on every visit.
  8. KPIs + activity re-poll every 30s; relative timestamps tick every 60s.
  9. (optional) Use the sidebar to navigate to sub-pages (account, analytics, settings, agents, avatars, tokens, monetize, etc.); open the command palette; open the live-event drawer (pulses on new events); dismiss onboarding/announce banners.
  10. (optional) If the user arrived via a referral link, `claimPendingReferral()` attributes it now that a session exists (no-op otherwise). It runs from the shared shell (`src/dashboard-next/shell.js`), so it fires on every dashboard page, not just the overview.
- **Decision points / branches:** New vs returning user (onboarding banner); each data slot renders, empties, or errors independently; referral-claim runs only with a pending code.
- **External calls / dependencies:** `GET /api/auth/me`, `GET /api/avatars`, `GET /api/widgets`, `GET /api/agents`; the trading strip fetches `GET /api/sniper/strategy?limit=30`, `GET /api/copy/subscriptions`, `GET /api/oracle/stats`, `GET /api/oracle/feed?tier=prime&limit=3&network=mainnet`; KPI/activity refresh adds per-widget `GET /api/widgets/{id}/stats` / `.../transcripts`; shared `tour.js`, `crypto-optional.js`, `log.js`.
- **Success state:** Authenticated overview rendered with live KPIs, hero avatars, and activity; navigation chrome fully wired.
- **Empty / error states:** Per-slot skeletons during load; new-user onboarding panel as the "empty" guidance; failed data fetches degrade per slot (empty arrays) rather than failing the page; unauthenticated → redirect to `/login`.
- **Step count:** 8 required (+2 optional)

---

### Account management — `/dashboard/account`
- **Source:** `src/dashboard-next/pages/account.js` (+ shell + `api.js`).
- **Entry point:** Sidebar "Account"; quick-links; `/dashboard/wallets`, `/dashboard/actions`, `/dashboard/sns`, `/dashboard/delegation` all 301 here.
- **Prerequisites / gates:** Signed-in required (`requireUser()` → `/login?return=…` on 401).
- **Steps (N):**
  1. Boot: `mountShell()` then `requireUser()`.
  2. Page renders sections in order: **Profile** (display name, username, sign out), **AI Provider Keys**, **Linked Wallets**, **Vanity Wallets** (Solana + ETH CREATE2), **SNS / .sol handle domains**, **Delegation** console, **Action Log / audit trail**, and quick links to settings/storage/usage/ERC-8004.
  3. **(optional) Update profile:** click edit on the name row → inline input (max 60) → **Save** → `PATCH /api/auth/profile` `{ display_name }` → toast "Saved", profile re-renders. Username edit → `PATCH /api/auth/profile` `{ username }` → toast "Username saved".
  4. **(optional) Provider keys:** eight named providers (anthropic, openai, grok, meshy, tripo, rodin, stability, replicate; a note explains OpenRouter and Groq are provided free, no key needed). Enter a key → **Save** → `PATCH /api/user/provider-keys` `{ [provider]: value }` → toast "Key saved"; clear → `PATCH …` `{ [provider]: null }` → toast "Key removed".
  5. **(optional) Linked wallets:** list from `GET /api/auth/wallets`. "Make primary" → `POST /api/auth/wallets/primary` `{ address }` → toast "Primary wallet updated" + refresh. "Disconnect" → confirm → `DELETE /api/auth/wallets/{address}` → toast "Wallet disconnected" + row removed. "+ Link wallet" routes to the wallet-linking flow.
  6. **(optional) SNS / vanity:** "Register domain" → `/vanity-wallet`; "Manage" → external `sns.id`; vanity tools open `/vanity-wallet` and `/eth-vanity`.
  7. **(optional) Delegation:** open console → pick target agent + message (max 8000) → **Run delegation** → `POST /api/agent-delegate` `{ toAgentId, message }` → response box with model tag; status-specific errors (429/404/503).
  8. **(optional) Audit log:** "Export CSV" → `GET /api/audit-log?format=csv` → toast "CSV downloaded"; "Load older" paginates `GET /api/audit-log`.
  9. **(optional) Sign out:** `POST /api/auth/logout` → redirect to `/`.
- **Decision points / branches:** Each section is independent; wallet/SNS sections show empty states when nothing is linked; delegation requires at least one agent.
- **External calls / dependencies:** `GET /api/auth/me`, `PATCH /api/auth/profile`, `PATCH /api/user/provider-keys`, `GET /api/auth/wallets`, `GET /api/sns?address=…` (per Solana wallet, to resolve .sol domains), `POST /api/auth/wallets/primary`, `DELETE /api/auth/wallets/{address}`, `POST /api/agent-delegate`, `GET /api/audit-log`, `POST /api/auth/logout`.
- **Success state:** Toasts on each mutation (Saved / Username saved / Key saved / Primary wallet updated / Wallet disconnected / CSV downloaded); sections re-render with fresh data.
- **Empty / error states:** "No wallets linked", "No Solana wallets linked", "No primary .sol domains found", "No agents to delegate", "Audit log is empty"; load-failure toasts ("Couldn't load &lt;section&gt;"); audit 404 ("endpoint not deployed yet"), 401 ("Sign in required").
- **Step count:** 2 required (boot + render) (+7 optional management flows)

### Dashboard settings (app preferences) — `/dashboard/settings`
- **Source:** `src/dashboard-next/pages/settings.js` (+ shell + `api.js`). `/dashboard/sessions`, `/dashboard/voice`, `/dashboard/storage` and several legacy routes 301 here.
- **Entry point:** Sidebar "Settings"; quick-links from `/dashboard/account`.
- **Prerequisites / gates:** Signed-in required (`requireUser()`; 401 → `/login?return=…`).
- **Steps (N):**
  1. Boot: `mountShell()` → `requireUser()`; 4 skeletons while data loads.
  2. Parallel fetch: `GET /api/auth/sessions`, `GET /api/oauth/grants`, `GET /api/notifications?limit=20`, `GET /api/notifications/preferences`, `GET /api/avatars/mine?limit=24` (per-avatar storage mode), `GET /api/billing/summary` (storage), `GET /api/usage/summary` (LLM usage), `GET /api/dashboard/prefs`, `GET /api/version` (About).
  3. Render sections: **Appearance/theme**, **Active sessions**, **Connected apps**, **Notifications**, **Notification preferences**, **Default payment network**, **Avatar storage**, **Storage usage**, **LLM usage**, **Vanity wallet tools**, **Preferences**, **Data export**, **About**.
  4. **(optional) Theme:** click Dark/Light/Auto → `localStorage['twx_theme']` (+ `window.threeTheme.set`) → toast "Theme applied" (no API).
  5. **(optional) Sessions:** "Revoke" → `DELETE /api/auth/sessions/{id}` → toast + row removed; "Revoke all other" → `DELETE /api/auth/sessions` (revokes every other session **and rotates the current session cookie**) → toast.
  5b. **(optional) Connected apps** (`#connected-apps`, deep-linked from the OAuth consent screen and three.ws Desktop): one row per app holding a live refresh token (the desktop app, the CLI, MCP clients) with its scopes in plain words, last used and authorized times. **Revoke** → confirm → `DELETE /api/oauth/grants?client_id=` → toast and the row drops; the app loses access when its current token expires (within an hour). Empty state: "No connected apps".
  6. **(optional) Notifications:** "Mark all read" → `POST /api/notifications/read-all` → toast. The inbox covers the full bell vocabulary (sales, purchases, follows, remixes, DMs, coin-launch graduations, IRL, market, account).
  6b. **(optional) Notification preferences:** a category × channel matrix driven by the server response (`categories` + `channels`, default channels in-app / push / email / Telegram / Discord / avatar). The **Avatar** column routes a category to the corner companion, which walks on screen and says the message out loud while the user is on the site; a hint line under the table explains it, and it can be muted per browser from the bubble's "Turn off" control. The response also carries `type_categories` (notification type → category), so the client-side herald (`src/notification-herald.js`) gates the avatar channel with the same mapping the server uses for push and email. Toggles flip locally; a single **Save notification preferences** button sends the whole matrix via `PUT /api/notifications/preferences` `{ categories }` → toast "Notification preferences saved". Per-category `lockedChannels` render disabled (in-app is typically locked on); the Telegram and Discord columns stay disabled until the account has a chat paired with notifications on through the chat gateways (`/api/gateway/connections`; the response's `gateways` block counts them) or, for Telegram only, a legacy `telegram_chat_id`. Their disabled tooltip reads "Pair a Telegram (or Discord) chat at /settings/connections to enable", but no page is served at that path yet, so pairing currently happens through the gateway API and the bot's `/link <code>` command. A footer reports subscribed push devices, counting Web Push subscriptions and iOS (APNs) devices together (`push.subscribed_devices`, with `push.ios_devices` broken out).
  6c. **(optional) Avatar storage (R2 vs IPFS):** one row per avatar the caller owns, listing its size, its R2 copy, and its IPFS state. `GET /api/avatars/mine` carries a flattened `storage` block (`primary`, `r2_present`, `ipfs_pinned`, `ipfs_cid`, `ipfs_pinned_at`) so the panel needs no per-avatar request. **Pin to IPFS** → `POST /api/avatars/:id/pin-ipfs` reads the object out of R2 and pins it through the provider chain (Pinata, then web3.storage), and the row repaints with the CID linked to a public gateway. A deployment with no pinning provider answers `stub: true` with a `stub:` pseudo-CID: that is a recorded content hash, not a pin, and the row says exactly that ("Content hash only") instead of linking a CID that resolves nowhere. The **R2 / IPFS** segmented control sets which copy a viewer resolves first; it re-reads `GET /api/avatars/:id/storage-mode` and writes the whole record back with `PUT`, because the schema is whole-object and the server owns the attestation block. The IPFS half stays disabled until a real pin exists.
  7. **(optional) Default network:** Base/Solana/Polygon → `localStorage['twx_default_network']` + best-effort `PATCH /api/dashboard/prefs` `{ prefs: { default_network } }` → toast.
  8. **(optional) Preferences:** toggle email notifications / show tips / compact sidebar → **Save preferences** → `PATCH /api/dashboard/prefs` `{ prefs }` → toast "Preferences saved".
  9. **(optional) Data export:** Agents / Avatars / All → fetch `GET /api/agents`, `GET /api/avatars?limit=100`, `GET /api/widgets` → build JSON blob → browser download → toast "Data exported".
- **Decision points / branches:** Theme, default network, and privacy-style toggles are local-first (localStorage) with best-effort prefs sync; sessions/notifications/export hit live APIs. Read-only meters for storage/LLM usage.
- **External calls / dependencies:** `GET /api/auth/me`, `GET /api/auth/sessions`, `DELETE /api/auth/sessions/{id}`, `DELETE /api/auth/sessions` (revoke-others + cookie rotation), `GET /api/oauth/grants`, `DELETE /api/oauth/grants?client_id=`, `GET /api/notifications`, `POST /api/notifications/read-all`, `GET /api/notifications/preferences`, `PUT /api/notifications/preferences`, `GET /api/avatars/mine`, `POST /api/avatars/{id}/pin-ipfs`, `GET`/`PUT /api/avatars/{id}/storage-mode`, `GET /api/billing/summary`, `GET /api/usage/summary`, `GET`/`PATCH /api/dashboard/prefs`, `GET /api/version`, `GET /api/agents`, `GET /api/avatars`, `GET /api/widgets`.
- **Success state:** Toasts on each action (Theme applied / Session revoked / <app> revoked / All notifications marked read / Default network set / Preferences saved / Data exported); sections reflect new state.
- **Empty / error states:** "No session data", "No notifications" / "You're all caught up", "No avatars yet" (with a **Create an avatar** action to `/create`), "No usage data"; a panel whose fetch failed renders an in-place error state with a working **Retry** that re-fetches every panel; per-action error toasts with button re-enable for retry; skeletons during load.
- **Step count:** 3 required (boot + fetch + render) (+7 optional setting flows)

### Account settings (profile / security hub) — `/settings`
- **Source:** `public/settings/index.html` (standalone page, inline module script). **Distinct page** from `/dashboard/settings` — neither redirects to the other.
- **Entry point:** Direct nav to `/settings`; header/account menu "Settings"; deep links to tab hashes (`#profile`, `#account`, `#privacy`, `#sessions`, `#connected-accounts`, `#danger`).
- **Prerequisites / gates:** Signed-in required. `loadUser()` → `GET /api/auth/me`; if no user / 401 → `location` to `/login?next=/settings`.
- **Steps (N):**
  1. Page loads; `GET /api/auth/me` resolves the user (or redirects to login).
  2. Tabbed UI renders (default `#profile`); fields populate from the user record + follow-up fetches.
  3. **Profile tab:** edit display name (max 80) + username (3–30, pattern-validated, live profile-URL preview) → **Save changes** → `PATCH /api/auth/profile` `{ display_name, username }` → "Saved!" inline message (4s) + URL preview update.
  4. **(optional) Account tab:** read-only email with Verified/Unverified badge (`user.email_verified`); password "Reset via email ↗" → `/forgot-password`; connected wallets count from `GET /api/auth/wallets` (→ `/dashboard/account` to manage); plan display (→ `/dashboard#billing`); **Sign out everywhere** → `POST /api/auth/logout-everywhere` → clear localStorage → redirect to `/login`.
  5. **(optional) Privacy tab:** default avatar visibility select (private/unlisted/public) → **Save** → `localStorage['3dagent:default-vis']` → "Saved preference."
  6. **(optional) Sessions tab:** list from `GET /api/auth/sessions` (device/IP/date); "Revoke" → `DELETE /api/auth/sessions/{id}` (row removed); **Revoke all other sessions** → `DELETE /api/auth/sessions` → "All other sessions revoked." + reload.
  7. **(optional) Connected Accounts tab:** GitHub status `GET /api/auth/github/status`; connect → `/api/auth/github/connect?agent_id=…` (the callback requires the same signed-in session that started it; a callback with no session or a different one returns to `/settings?tab=connected-accounts&github=error`); seed agent memory → `POST /api/agents/{agentId}/memory-seed`. X status `GET /api/agents/{agentId}/memory/seed/x`; connect → `/api/auth/x/connect?agent_id=…`; seed → `POST /api/agents/{agentId}/memory/seed/x`. Supports `?agent_id=` prefill.
  8. **(optional) Danger Zone tab:** click "Delete my account…" → type "delete my account" to enable → **Permanently delete** → `DELETE /api/auth/me` with `{ confirm: 'delete my account' }` (the server refuses without the phrase, `400 confirmation_required`) → the account's avatars, agents, and widgets are retired, the `/u/<username>` handle is released, every session is revoked and the cookie cleared → clear localStorage → redirect to `/?deleted=1`. Sign-in is refused afterwards (wallet/SAML paths answer `account_deleted`).
- **Decision points / branches:** Six hash-routed tabs; profile is the primary editable surface; privacy is local-only; account/sessions/connections/danger hit live APIs. Distinct from `/dashboard/settings` (which is app preferences, no identity/security fields).
- **External calls / dependencies:** `GET /api/auth/me`, `PATCH /api/auth/profile`, `GET /api/auth/wallets`, `POST /api/auth/logout-everywhere`, `GET /api/auth/sessions`, `DELETE /api/auth/sessions/{id}`, `DELETE /api/auth/sessions`, `GET /api/auth/github/status`, `/api/auth/github/connect`, `POST /api/agents/{id}/memory-seed`, `GET`/`POST /api/agents/{id}/memory/seed/x`, `/api/auth/x/connect`, `DELETE /api/auth/me`.
- **Success state:** "Saved!" / "Saved preference." / "All other sessions revoked." inline messages (auto-hide 4s); GitHub/X "Connected" tags; account deletion redirect to `/?deleted=1`.
- **Empty / error states:** "No sessions found."; "Not connected" + connect buttons for GitHub/X; inline `.ok`/`.err` messages; delete-flow confirmation gate + error alert with button revert; "Checking…"/"Loading…" placeholders during async loads.
- **Fixed 2026-08-06 (was: two broken writes):** the page ran on a local `fetch` helper that attached no `x-csrf-token`, so profile **Save changes** and both session revokes were rejected in production with `403 csrf_missing` while the UI still reported success; and the Danger Zone called a `DELETE /api/auth/me` the server did not implement (`me` was GET-only), so deletion always ended in the "contact support" alert. Every call on the page now goes through the shared CSRF-carrying client (`src/api.js`, which also bounds every call: 20 s for reads, 90 s for mutations, `timeoutMs` to override), a non-ok response surfaces as an error instead of a false success, and `DELETE /api/auth/me` is implemented (see [authentication.md](../authentication.md#deleting-the-account)).
- **Step count:** 3 required (boot + profile load + save profile) (+5 optional tab flows)

## Notes on routing edge cases

- **No login/register modal:** auth is full-page (`/login`, `/register`). Other surfaces trigger it by redirect (`requireAuth()` in `src/auth/email-auth.js`, `requireUser()` in `src/dashboard-next/api.js`), preserving the origin via `?return=`/`?next=`. The dashboard chrome itself is gated, not the marketing pages.
- **Two settings surfaces, intentionally separate:** `/settings` = identity/security/connections/danger (profile hub); `/dashboard/settings` = app/dashboard preferences (theme, sessions, notifications, network, storage/LLM meters, export). They share only the concept of "sessions" (each with its own UI and revoke calls).
- **Heavy 301 consolidation:** `/dashboard-classic/*` and many legacy `/dashboard/*` slugs (wallets, sessions, actions, memory, strategy, voice, sns, delegation, storage, usage, agent-pumpfun) redirect to the canonical `/dashboard/*` pages in `vercel.json`. `/dashboard/x402` is not one of them: it is its own page, served from `public/dashboard/x402.html`. The Vite dev middleware mirrors only the `/dashboard-classic/*` family; the bare legacy slugs 301 in prod but have no dev equivalent.
