# Chat, Brain & Labs

UX Flow Atlas cluster covering the conversational, multi-LLM, and experimental-feature
surfaces of three.ws. Each entry traces real source from route → page HTML → imported
modules. Routes resolved via `vercel.json` rewrites.

### Conversational AI Chat (3D talking agent) — `/chat`
- **Source:** `/workspaces/three.ws/chat/` (a standalone Svelte app, separate Vite build). Entry `/workspaces/three.ws/chat/index.html` → `/workspaces/three.ws/chat/src/main.js` → `/workspaces/three.ws/chat/src/App.svelte`. Key modules: `chat/src/providers.js` (LLM providers), `chat/src/convo.js` (streaming completion pipeline), `chat/src/AgentPicker.svelte`, `chat/src/ModelSelector.svelte`, `chat/src/stores.js`, `chat/src/walletAuth.js` (SIWE/SIWS), `chat/src/tools.js`, `chat/src/sync.js`, `chat/src/SkillsMarketplaceModal.svelte`, `chat/src/TxApprovalModal.svelte`.
- **Entry point:** `/chat` → `chat/index.html` (`<div id="app">` mounted by `main.js`).
- **Prerequisites / gates:** None to start chatting: free built-in models stream through the server proxy with no key. Optional gates: user-supplied API key (Anthropic/OpenAI/Groq/Mistral/Ollama/OpenRouter) stored locally for non-built-in models; sign-in only for cross-device sync + on-chain tool calls, either by wallet (SIWE/SIWS via `/api/auth/*`, `chat/src/walletAuth.js`) or by email/password on the platform's own cookie session (`chat/src/passwordAuth.js` POSTs `/api/auth/login` / `/api/auth/register`, with the Terms clickwrap gating the submit); `TxApprovalModal` requires a connected wallet for wallet/pump tool transactions. No $THREE gate. Voice output is opt-in (off by default).
- **Steps (6):**
  1. Open `/chat`; app boots, fetches the free model list from `/api/chat/models`, shows empty state with suggestion chips. `BUILTIN_MODELS` in `providers.js` is only a first-paint seed; `resolveDefaultModel()` prefers a model the server reports as live, so if the configured default has been retired upstream a new conversation opens on a live model instead of a dead one. The list also carries one virtual entry, "three.ws Agent · server tools": a server-side agent loop that answers through `/api/chat/proxy` in the same wire format but runs multiple tool-calling LLM rounds per message; it is appended last so it can never become the silent default.
  2. (optional) Click the model selector and pick an LLM, or open `AgentPicker` to load a persona/agent (from `/api/agents`, `/api/marketplace/agents`, or the agent library JSON). Loading an agent mounts its live `<agent-3d>` avatar in the panel.
  3. (optional) Open Settings → Avatar and turn on "Speak replies aloud", optionally picking one of the browser's installed voices and previewing it. The sidebar holding the Settings button renders once a conversation has messages, so a first-time visitor reaches it after their first reply.
  4. Type a message in the composer and submit (or attach an image / file for multimodal).
  5. `convo.complete()` POSTs to the provider's completion URL (built-in → `/api/chat/proxy`; Anthropic → `/v1/messages`; others → `/v1/chat/completions`) and streams tokens back into the assistant bubble (markdown + KaTeX rendered live).
  6. On reply completion: if an agent is loaded, its `<agent-3d>` avatar plays the talk animation (`agentEl.speak(...)`) and expresses the classified emotion (`agentEl.expressEmotion(...)`); those two calls are animation only and carry no audio. With voice output enabled, browser `speechSynthesis` reads the reply aloud, agent or not. Payoff: a 3D agent that answers in voice with mood animation.
- **Decision points / branches:** model/provider choice (free built-in vs keyed provider vs OpenRouter "all models" vs local Ollama); text vs voice output (agent-3d speech vs browser speechSynthesis vs silent); persona/agent loaded vs raw model; tool-calling on/off (16 curated tool packs in `tools.js` `curatedToolPacks`, surfaced via `ToolPackModal`: wallet-transactions, x402-pay, tradingview, price-chart-3d, token-price, token-ticker-3d, web-search, date-time, pump-launch, tx-explain, mint-scene-nft, nft-3d-import, forge-text-to-3d, forge-avatar, wallet-balances, token-gate-scene; the built-in wallet/agent/pump/payments tool schemas back them); every generated 3D model card carries "View in AR ↗" (`/ar?src=<glb>`), "Download GLB", and "Viewer ↗" actions; regenerate / edit / branch a message; share conversation (compressed link via `share.js`).
- **External calls / dependencies:** `/api/chat/models` (free model list, OpenRouter-proxied), `/api/chat/proxy` (built-in completions), `/api/chat/config`, `/api/mcp` + `/api/pump-fun-mcp` (skills marketplace / pump tools), `/api/agents` + `/api/marketplace/agents` (agent picker), `/api/auth/{me,logout,siwe/nonce,siwe/verify,siws/nonce,siws/verify}` (wallet auth), `/api/auth/{login,register}` (email/password auth), agent-library `index.en-US.json`. Direct provider APIs (api.anthropic.com, api.openai.com, api.groq.com, api.mistral.ai, openrouter.ai, local Ollama) when a user key is set.
- **Success state:** Streamed assistant message rendered; with voice enabled the reply is read aloud once per message (a repeated end-of-stream chunk cannot double-speak it), and a loaded agent mouths along with mood animation; conversation persisted to IndexedDB / optional E2E-encrypted sync.
- **Empty / error states:** Empty state with brand tagline + suggestion chips when no messages. Provider/network errors surface as inline notices: a request that never left the device is tagged `code: 'network'` in `convo.js` and renders "Could not reach the model. The request never left this device, so nothing was sent…" with a hover-refresh hint, and a stream that dies mid-reply renders "The reply stopped early because the connection dropped…" instead of the transport's own wording; the built-in proxy waits at most 25s for OpenRouter to start answering, rotates keys and models on a timeout, and reports a clean 504 when every route hangs. Abortable generation via `controller`. Missing API key → model marked unavailable in selector. Avatar GLB load failure falls back to default avatar; speech failure degrades silently to text.
- **Step count:** 6 required (+4 optional)
- **Voice path (resolved 2026-08-06):** there is exactly one speaker, browser `speechSynthesis`, gated on the voice-output toggle. The legacy standalone Talking Head component (a CDN build of met4citizen/TalkingHead pointed at the long-retired `/api/tts/google`) was imported but never rendered, and its dead `talkingHeadEnabled` flag suppressed `speechSynthesis` for anyone whose browser still carried the flag from an older build. Component, flag, and both dead branches are removed. `talkingHeadAvatarUrl` survives on purpose: it is the live store behind the Settings avatar picker, the sidebar logo, and the in-reply `<agent-3d>` viewer.

### Agent Profile / Directory — `/agent`
- **Source:** `/agent` is a **301 redirect to `/agents`** (`vercel.json`). The directory `/agents` → `/workspaces/three.ws/pages/agents/index.html`; a single agent `/agents/:id` → `/workspaces/three.ws/pages/agent-detail.html` → `/workspaces/three.ws/src/agent-detail.js`. Supporting: `src/shared/agent-3d.js` (`seeInWorldHref`, `agentAvatarGlb`), `src/shared/agent-wallet-chip.js`, `src/shared/agent-coin.js`, `src/agent-detail-market.js`. (`src/agent-home.js` is a related presence component used by `/app` + `/app-demo`, not by `/agents/:id`.)
- **Entry point:** `/agent` (redirect) → `/agents` directory grid → click an agent → `/agents/:id` profile.
- **Prerequisites / gates:** None to view. Editing (`/agents/:id/edit` → `agent-edit.html`; the older `/agent/:id/…` subroutes still resolve but every link now uses the canonical `/agents/:id/…` form) and owner actions require wallet/owner auth. No $THREE gate to browse.
- **Steps (4):**
  1. Hit `/agent` → 301 to `/agents`; directory of agents renders.
  2. Click an agent card → `/agents/:id` loads `agent-detail.js`.
  3. Profile renders: a live Three.js hero avatar (`mountIdleAvatar` retargets the canonical idle clip onto the rig with a procedural idle-life loop; no static `<model-viewer>`), identity, voice metadata (cloned provider or browser TTS pill), live $THREE/pump token chip (streamed via `/api/pump/by-agent`), skills (with dynamic price/promo state from `/api/marketplace/skill-promo?agent_id=…&skill=…`), history.
  4. Click "See in world" → routes to `/play?avatar=<glb>&coin=<THREE_MINT>` (the 3D world payoff); or "Edit" / wallet chip / coin-launch actions for owners.
- **Decision points / branches:** view vs edit (owner); "See in world" (→ /play) vs embed (`/agents/:id/embed`) vs wallet (`/agents/:id/wallet`); token chip present (launched coin) vs not; a `/agents/:id?skill=<name>#pricing` deep link (what the Buy CTA on `/conversions` sends) scrolls the pricing card to that skill row once it renders (`focusRequestedSkill` in `agent-detail-market.js`, honoured once per page load).
- **External calls / dependencies:** `/api/agents/:id`, `/api/marketplace/agents/:id`, `/api/pump/by-agent` (live market-cap stream), `/api/marketplace/skill-promo` (skill pricing/promo), `/api/agent-share` (share). Three.js idle-avatar mount for the 3D preview (falls back to a flat image when WebGL/GLB fails).
- **Success state:** Agent profile with interactive 3D avatar, live token data, and working navigation to world/embed/edit.
- **Empty / error states:** Avatar mount failure → flat-image fallback; enrich failure logged non-fatally; save errors surface inline in the edit flow.
- **Step count:** 4 required (+2 optional)
- **Note:** This route is a profile/directory surface, **not** a chat interface. The "talk to a 3D agent" experience lives at `/chat`. `/agents/:id` links *out* to `/play` ("See in world"), not to an inline chat.

### Brain — Persona Builder + Multi-LLM Playground — `/brain`
- **Source:** `/workspaces/three.ws/pages/brain.html` → `/workspaces/three.ws/src/brain.js`.
- **Entry point:** `/brain` → `brain.html` (H1 "Pick a vibe", sub-copy "One tap gives your agent a personality. No extra steps."; "Build Persona" is a sidebar button), two tabs: Persona + Playground.
- **Prerequisites / gates:** None to open the playground, but signed-out callers are limited to the free-model set (`ANON_BRAIN_PROVIDERS` in `api/brain/chat.js`: gpt-oss-120b plus the NVIDIA NIM family); every paid first-party model returns `401 "sign in to use this model"`, and anonymous traffic is rate limited. `GET /api/brain/chat` reports `requiresAuth` per model alongside `available`, so the page suffixes those chips "(sign in)" for a signed-out visitor and answers a click with the notice "<model> needs an account." plus a Sign in link (`/login?redirect=/brain`) instead of failing after Send. Freeform persona extraction (`POST /api/persona/extract`) also requires sign-in (`401 "Sign in to build your persona."`; the Persona tab shows a "Sign in to build your persona" gate that clears once you sign in and return) and is metered at 5 extractions per user per day. Saving a persona as a deployed agent requires sign-in (auth-hint check + `/api/agents` with credentials). No $THREE gate.
- **Steps (6):**
  1. Open `/brain`; Persona tab active, archetype presets rendered.
  2. (optional) Apply an archetype preset or type freeform persona text → `/api/persona/extract` structures it into a persona object (tone, vocabulary, interests, communication_style, dont_say, sample_greeting); the body is validated before the daily limiter is charged, and an empty model reply comes back as a retryable `502` rather than a blank card.
  3. Switch to the Playground tab; provider availability fetched from `GET /api/brain/chat` (each model carries `available` and `requiresAuth`), model chips/focus selector populated.
  4. Choose **Compare** mode (query several models at once) or **Focus** mode (one model); select active models.
  5. Type a prompt and run; `streamProvider()` POSTs to `/api/brain/chat` per model and streams responses side-by-side, each prefixed with the effective persona system prompt.
  6. (optional) Save the persona as an agent → POST `/api/agents` (or PATCH `/api/agents/:id`) with the built `system_prompt`.
- **Decision points / branches:** Compare (multi-model fan-out) vs Focus (single model); persona enabled/disabled (`personaEnabled` toggle injects/omits the system prompt); archetype preset vs freeform extraction; model availability (unavailable models disabled in selector); save-as-agent (gated by auth).
- **External calls / dependencies:** `GET /api/brain/chat` (provider availability), `POST /api/brain/chat` (per-model streaming completions), `/api/persona/extract` (structure persona), `/api/agents` + `/api/agents/:id` (load/save agent). Models span Anthropic (via Google Vertex), OpenAI (via OpenRouter), xAI Grok, DeepSeek, Qwen/DashScope, IBM watsonx, NVIDIA NIM, and Google Vertex Gemini tiers.
- **Success state:** Multiple model responses stream into the compare grid (or one in focus); persona optionally persisted locally and/or saved as a deployable agent.
- **Empty / error states:** "Select at least one model" notice; provider-availability fetch failure is non-fatal (all models treated available); upstream stream error surfaces per-model, and when every rung of a model's fallback chain fails the column shows a plain-language verdict (rate limited: try again or pick another model; no working route on this deployment; no longer served upstream; took too long) with the precise upstream reason alongside as `reason`; signed-out use of a paid model errors with a sign-in prompt; auth gate shown when saving while signed out; sessions/persona persisted to localStorage.
- **Step count:** 6 required (+2 optional)

---

### GLB Playground / Embed Generator — `/playground`
- **Source:** `/workspaces/three.ws/pages/playground.html` — **self-contained** (inline `<script>` IIFE, no `/src` module). Uses Google `<model-viewer>` (CDN) for rendering.
- **Entry point:** `/playground` → `playground.html` (H1 "Playground"), drag-drop GLB viewer + embed-code generator.
- **Prerequisites / gates:** None. No auth, no wallet, no $THREE. Files stay client-side.
- **Steps (5):**
  1. Open `/playground`; default avatar (`/avatars/default.glb`) loads into the `<model-viewer>`.
  2. Drag-and-drop or upload a `.glb`/`.gltf` file into the dropzone (or use the file picker).
  3. Model loads with a loading indicator; file info (name, size, animation count) populates.
  4. (optional) Pick an animation from the dropdown, play/pause it, adjust exposure slider, orbit/zoom the model.
  5. Copy the generated `<model-viewer>` embed code from the embed panel to use the model on any site.
- **Decision points / branches:** default avatar vs uploaded model; local file (embed note warns the URL must be hosted) vs hosted URL; animated vs static GLB (animation section only shows when clips exist); reset to default.
- **External calls / dependencies:** Google model-viewer CDN (`ajax.googleapis.com/.../model-viewer.min.js`). No backend API calls — all parsing is in-browser via model-viewer.
- **Success state:** Model renders interactively (rotate/zoom, optional animation playback) and a copyable embed snippet is produced.
- **Empty / error states:** Status line shows transient messages (auto-clears after 3s); invalid/failed file → status error and the viewer retains the prior/default model; embed note flags that local files need a hosted URL before the embed works.
- **Step count:** 5 required (+1 optional)
- **Note:** `src/api-playground.js` exists but is a different surface (API console), not wired into `/playground`.

---

### Labs — Feature Gallery — `/labs`
- **Source:** `/workspaces/three.ws/pages/labs.html` → `/workspaces/three.ws/src/labs.js`. Data: `/features.json` (generated by `scripts/build-page-index.mjs` from `data/pages.json`; `labs.js` flattens its `sections[].pages` and shows only pages flagged `showcase: true`).
- **Entry point:** `/labs` → `labs.html`; grid of "gem" cards.
- **Prerequisites / gates:** None. Pure discovery surface.
- **Steps (3):**
  1. Open `/labs`; skeleton placeholders render while `/features.json` is fetched.
  2. Cards render (category-colored: Voice / AI / 3D Live / Crypto / x402); each runs a `HEAD` liveness check (3s timeout) and shows a Live/Checking status, plus a lazy IntersectionObserver iframe preview of the route.
  3. Click a card's "Try it →" CTA → navigates to that feature's route (e.g. `/lipsync`, `/brain`, `/three-live`, `/voice`).
- **Decision points / branches:** category filtering (Voice/AI/3D/Crypto/x402); live vs unreachable (status badge from HEAD check); preview iframe lazy-loads only when scrolled into view.
- **External calls / dependencies:** `GET /features.json` (registry), `HEAD <route>` per card (liveness), iframe `src=<route>` (sandboxed previews).
- **Success state:** Populated gallery of feature cards with live previews and working "Try it" links into each experiment.
- **Empty / error states:** Skeleton loading state; per-card "Checking → Live/Offline" status; HEAD failure (or ≥500) marks a card not-live; registry fetch failure leaves skeletons / empty grid.
- **Step count:** 3 required (+1 optional)

---

### Launchpad Studio — `/launchpad`
- **Source:** `/workspaces/three.ws/pages/launchpad.html` → `mountLaunchpadLanding` from `/workspaces/three.ws/src/launchpad/landing.js` (a discovery front door), which lazy-imports `mountLaunchpadStudio` from `/workspaces/three.ws/src/editor/launchpad-studio.js` only when the URL deep-links the editor.
- **Entry point:** Bare `/launchpad` renders the landing page; a URL carrying `?slug=`, `?template=`, `?wallet=`, `?avatar=`, `?build`, or `?studio` mounts the studio into `#root` (3-pane: sidebar / live-preview stage / config rail).
- **Prerequisites / gates:** Building/previewing is open, and so is a first publish: anonymous publishing is allowed by design. **Publishing requires a payout wallet address** (throws "Add your payout wallet address." otherwise, validated against the selected chain server-side) and writes via `/api/launchpad/publish`; editing an existing published page (`?slug=`) hydrates via the public `/api/launchpad/get` read, and re-publishing it requires the `ownerSecret` the first publish stored in localStorage or a signed-in session matching the page's owner (anything else answers `409 slug_taken`). Templates include a Token Launchpad (one-click Pump.fun mint with creator-fee split; generic runtime mint, $THREE-compliant). No $THREE gate to use the editor.
- **Steps (6):**
  1. Open `/launchpad`; the landing renders. Enter the studio via a template/build CTA (or a deep-linked URL); the studio mounts with a default template (`token-launchpad`) and recent-projects from localStorage.
  2. Pick a template card (`token-launchpad`, `paid-concierge`, or `gated-showroom`).
  3. Fill the config form (slug, brand color, payout wallet, website, theme, avatar, monetization/chain) — live preview updates in the center stage.
  4. (optional) Attach a 3D avatar (agent-3d element) into the avatar-stage slot.
  5. Add the payout wallet address (required for publish).
  6. Click Publish → `POST /api/launchpad/publish`; on success the page is hosted at `/p/<slug>` and the returned `ownerSecret` is kept in localStorage for re-edits.
- **Decision points / branches:** landing browse vs studio deep-link; template choice (token-launchpad vs paid-concierge vs gated-showroom); new vs edit (`?slug=` hydration via `/api/launchpad/get`); chain/payout selection; signed-in owner vs anonymous (owner-only sections hidden on 401).
- **External calls / dependencies:** `POST /api/launchpad/publish`, `GET /api/launchpad/get` (hydrate existing), `/api/agents` (my-agents avatar picker), Pump.fun launch plumbing (runtime mint, creator-fee split). agent-3d / Three.js for the avatar preview.
- **Success state:** A live hosted page at `/p/<slug>` with the chosen template, brand, avatar, and (for token template) a one-click Pump.fun mint; editable later from the same browser.
- **Empty / error states:** Publish blocked with actionable message if no payout wallet; publish-status line shows ok/err; owner-only sections silently hidden when signed out (401); recent-projects empty on first visit.
- **Step count:** 6 required (+1 optional)

---

### Lip-Sync (TTS-driven) — `/lipsync`
- **Source:** `/workspaces/three.ws/public/demos/lipsync-tts.html` (vercel rewrite target `demos/lipsync-tts.html`; resolves under `public/demos/`). Inline `<script type="module">`; uses Three.js + GLTFLoader (importmap) and the `wawa-lipsync` library for viseme detection.
- **Entry point:** `/lipsync` → `lipsync-tts.html`; 3D avatar viewer (left) + text/voice controls (right).
- **Prerequisites / gates:** None client-side (no auth, wallet, mic, or $THREE). Requires WebGL; TTS is served by `/api/tts/speak`, which tries the free NVIDIA NIM Magpie lane first and falls back to OpenAI.
- **Steps (6):**
  1. Open `/lipsync`; avatar GLB (`/avatars/default.glb`) loads, viseme morphs wired, default text prefilled.
  2. (optional) Edit the text, pick a voice and speed.
  3. Click "Speak"; POST `/api/tts/speak` `{text, voice, speed, format:'mp3'}`.
  4. Server returns an MP3 blob; frontend plays it through an `<audio>` element connected to `wawa-lipsync`.
  5. Per animation frame, lipsync analyses the audio (FFT) → viseme code → mapped to avatar morph targets with EMA smoothing.
  6. Avatar mouth animates in sync; viseme bar chart updates live; "Speak" re-enables when playback ends.
- **Decision points / branches:** voice + speed selection; retry on TTS failure; avatar-load failure degrades (UI still works, morphs unavailable).
- **External calls / dependencies:** `POST /api/tts/speak` (lane 1 NVIDIA NIM Magpie, free, 30s budget; lane 2 OpenAI `/v1/audio/speech`, the paid backstop with its own 20s budget; `503 not_configured` when neither key is set), `GET /avatars/default.glb`, `wawa-lipsync` (client-side viseme analysis via Web Audio AnalyserNode), Three.js.
- **Success state:** Avatar speaks the text with synced lips; status log confirms playback + morphs wired.
- **Empty / error states:** Actionable errors for TTS unreachable / rejected text (400) / rate limit (429) / server error (5xx); autoplay-blocked → "needs a click to play"; avatar-load failure logged but non-blocking.
- **Step count:** 6 required (+1 optional)

---

### Lip-Sync (Microphone-driven) — `/lipsync/mic`
- **Source:** `/workspaces/three.ws/public/demos/lipsync-mic.html` → imports `/workspaces/three.ws/src/lip-sync-analyser.js` (`LipSyncAnalyser`). Three.js + GLTFLoader (importmap).
- **Entry point:** `/lipsync/mic` → `lipsync-mic.html`; avatar viewer + mic controls, meter bars, viseme readout.
- **Prerequisites / gates:** **Microphone permission** (getUserMedia) and a secure HTTPS context. No auth, wallet, or $THREE. Audio never leaves the browser.
- **Steps (6):**
  1. Open `/lipsync/mic`; avatar loads, controls idle.
  2. Click "Start mic".
  3. Browser prompts for microphone permission; user grants.
  4. AudioContext + MediaStreamSource + AnalyserNode wired; `LipSyncAnalyser.connect()` called.
  5. Per frame, `analyser.sample()` reads frequency bands → maps to 9 viseme weights (aa/O/E/I/nn/SS/FF/CH/PP) with EMA smoothing + silence fade → drives avatar morphs.
  6. Speak into the mic → avatar mouth follows live; meter bars + viseme readout update; "Stop" resets morphs to 0.
- **Decision points / branches:** start vs stop; permission granted vs denied; mic present/busy/secure-context branches.
- **External calls / dependencies:** Web Audio API (`getUserMedia`, AnalyserNode — all in-browser), `GET /avatars/default.glb`, Three.js. No server/TTS calls.
- **Success state:** Live mic-driven mouth animation with frequency meters and per-frame viseme weights.
- **Empty / error states:** Actionable errors for mic denied / not found / busy / insecure (non-HTTPS) context, each with a "Try again"; avatar-morph missing → readout shows n/a; Web Audio unsupported → silent no-op.
- **Step count:** 6 required (+0 optional)

---

### Club — 3D Pole-Stage Venue (x402) — `/club`
- **Source:** `/workspaces/three.ws/pages/club.html` → scripts: `/x402.js` (wallet/payment modal), `/workspaces/three.ws/src/club-entrance.js` (walk-in alley scene), `/workspaces/three.ws/src/club-gate.js` (cover-charge bouncer), `/workspaces/three.ws/src/club.js` (main pole stage). Supporting modules in `src/`: `club-venue.js`, `club-audio.js`, `club-camera.js`, `club-crowd.js`, `club-queue.js`, `club-bouncer.js`, `club-perf.js`, `club-sequence.js`, `animation-manager.js`.
- **Entry point:** `/club` → `club.html`; entrance scene + door gate + pole stage boot in parallel behind a loading screen.
- **Entrances:** the same page is served at more than one path, and the path picks the walk-in (`src/club-variant.js`). `/club` opens on the neon alley; `/stripclub` opens on a brick back alley (a CC BY 4.0 Sketchfab model by anthonydpc, credited on screen while it is visible and in `public/club/venue/LICENSES.md`). The cover charge, the pass, the gallery and clubhouse that follow, and the pole stage are shared, so a cover paid at one door is good at the other. An "Entrance" switcher under the agent picker links between them. If an entrance's own alley model cannot be loaded, the walk-in opens on the neon alley instead of failing.
- **Prerequisites / gates:** **x402 wallet payment**: a cover charge settled on-chain via `/api/x402/club-cover`; wallet (Phantom / EVM) connected through `x402.js`. The one door's 402 quotes both USDC and $THREE on Solana (while `X402_ACCEPT_THREE_SOLANA` is on, the default), so the checkout shows a token chooser with each token's real price and either token issues the same pass. Paying in $THREE is optional, not a gate. WebGL required.
- **Steps (7):**
  1. Open `/club`; loading screen with real GLB byte-count progress; avatar picker populates (bundled + gallery avatars via `/api/avatars/` and `/api/explore`).
  2. (optional) Select an avatar.
  3. Spawn in the entrance scene; move with WASD / touch joystick, look via drag. The alley is dressed as the outside of a club: a line of platform avatars waits along the wall behind a velvet rope, neighbours trade scripted exchanges in speech bubbles, and a few drunks sway, stagger and slide down the wall (`src/club-queue.js`; bodies come from `src/club-crowd.js`). The line reacts to you: walk past it to the door, crowd it, or get let in, and someone has something to say.
  4. Walk to the neon door → "Enter the club" prompt; activate it.
  5. Door reveals the x402 cover screen; connect wallet, pick USDC or $THREE in the token chooser, and pay the cover → a paid `GET /api/x402/club-cover` (x402, `club-gate.js`) settles on-chain and checks the gate.
  6. On approval the rope drops; walk through to the pole stage — entrance fades, main `club.js` stage becomes active (dancers at poles, leaderboard, live tip feed).
  7. Select a pole + dance style and tip → `POST /api/x402/dance-tip`; on settlement the dancer performs the routine, leaderboard + live feed update, reactions float up.
- **Decision points / branches:** avatar choice; cover approved vs "not tonight"; wallet not connected / insufficient balance; tip per pole + dance style; back-out to alley while paying; entrance-GLB failure → drop straight to stage.
- **External calls / dependencies:** `GET /api/x402/club-cover` (the door; a `POST` to the same path is a separate paid read for agents, `mode: "snapshot"` for membership growth/churn or `mode: "revenue"` for the door + floor take over a `period` of 24h/7d/14d/30d/all, not part of the visitor flow), `POST /api/x402/dance-tip`, `GET /api/club/tips`, SSE `/api/club/tips/stream`, `GET /api/club/leaderboard`, `/api/avatars/`, `/api/explore`; club venue/prop GLBs under `/club/...`, `/avatars/default.glb`, animation manifest/clips; `x402.js` wallet modal (Solana web3 / EVM). Three.js + post-processing.
- **Success state:** User is inside the 3D club after paying cover; tipping plays dance routines and updates the live leaderboard/feed in real time.
- **Empty / error states:** Cover denied → "not tonight" card (with reason); wallet-not-connected / insufficient-balance errors in the x402 modal; tip/clip load failure falls back to a default clip or bind pose; tip-stream disconnect → paused-feed badge with retry; entrance-GLB failure skips the walk-in.
- **Step count:** 7 required (+1 optional)
- **Note:** Some entrance/tip detail above is reconstructed from `club*.js` + endpoint references; exact on-stage routine names and per-pole UI copy were not exhaustively read.

### Feature Landing — Play — `/features/play`
- **Source:** `/workspaces/three.ws/pages/features/play.html` (static marketing). Shared loaders: `public/nav.js`, `public/footer.js`; inline FAQ-accordion script.
- **Entry point:** `/features/play` → `features/play.html`.
- **Prerequisites / gates:** None — explicitly "No wallet needed to explore".
- **Steps (2):**
  1. Read the marketing content (hero, biome swatches, FAQ accordion).
  2. Click the primary CTA "Enter a world →" → **`/play`** (secondary: "All features" → `/features`, "Try Walk instead" → `/features/walk`).
- **Decision points / branches:** primary CTA (→ /play) vs cross-link to /features or /features/walk; FAQ expand/collapse.
- **External calls / dependencies:** None (nav/footer loaders only; no API, no 3D viewer).
- **Success state:** User clicks through to the `/play` 3D world.
- **Empty / error states:** Static page — no data states; FAQ accordion is the only interaction.
- **Step count:** 2 required (+0 optional) — primarily content/landing.

### Feature Landing — AR — `/features/ar`
- **Source:** `/workspaces/three.ws/pages/features/ar.html` (static marketing with an embedded `<model-viewer>` AR preview). Shared `nav.js`/`footer.js`; model-viewer via Google CDN; inline FAQ script.
- **Entry point:** `/features/ar` → `features/ar.html`.
- **Prerequisites / gates:** None to view. The embedded model-viewer offers WebXR / Scene Viewer / Quick Look AR (uses device camera if the user taps the AR button).
- **Steps (3):**
  1. Read content; an interactive `<model-viewer>` (model `/animations/robotexpressive.glb`) rotates in the hero.
  2. (optional) On a supported device, tap the model-viewer AR button to place the model in AR (camera permission requested by the browser/OS).
  3. Click the primary CTA "Browse avatars →" → **`/gallery`** (secondary: "Generate a model" → `/forge`; doc links → `/docs/ar`, `/docs/tutorials/view-in-ar`, `/docs/web-component`).
- **Decision points / branches:** view-in-AR vs browse CTA vs generate CTA vs docs; FAQ accordion.
- **External calls / dependencies:** Google model-viewer CDN; GLB asset `/animations/robotexpressive.glb`. No backend API.
- **Success state:** User previews/places a model in AR or clicks through to `/gallery`.
- **Empty / error states:** Static; AR button only appears on AR-capable devices.
- **Step count:** 3 required (+1 optional) — primarily content with an interactive AR preview.

### Feature Landing — Walk — `/features/walk`
- **Source:** `/workspaces/three.ws/pages/features/walk.html` (static marketing with `<model-viewer>` auto-rotate preview). Shared `nav.js`/`footer.js`; model-viewer CDN; inline FAQ script.
- **Entry point:** `/features/walk` → `features/walk.html`.
- **Prerequisites / gates:** None.
- **Steps (2):**
  1. Read content; a `<model-viewer>` (model `/avatars/cz.glb`) auto-rotates (no AR button here).
  2. Click the primary CTA "Start walking →" → **`/walk`** (secondary: "All features" → `/features`, "Try Play instead" → `/features/play`).
- **Decision points / branches:** primary CTA (→ /walk) vs cross-links; FAQ accordion.
- **External calls / dependencies:** Google model-viewer CDN; GLB `/avatars/cz.glb`. No backend API.
- **Success state:** User clicks through to the `/walk` experience.
- **Empty / error states:** Static page.
- **Step count:** 2 required (+0 optional) — primarily content.

### Feature Landing — Deploy — `/features/deploy`
- **Source:** `/workspaces/three.ws/pages/features/deploy.html` (static marketing; no 3D viewer). Shared `nav.js`/`footer.js`; inline FAQ + static deploy-chain visualization.
- **Entry point:** `/features/deploy` → `features/deploy.html`.
- **Prerequisites / gates:** Landing is public. The actual deploy action (on the destination `/deploy` page) requires a Solana wallet to sign the on-chain transaction — the page describes "the UI previews the transaction and metadata before you sign".
- **Steps (2):**
  1. Read content (deploy-chain explainer, ERC-8004 directory references, FAQ).
  2. Click the primary CTA "Deploy now →" → **`/deploy`** (secondary: "Browse deployed agents" → `/discover`; FAQ links → `/discover`, `/features/marketplace`, `/features/studio`).
- **Decision points / branches:** deploy CTA (→ /deploy, wallet-gated at action) vs browse (→ /discover) vs feature cross-links; FAQ accordion.
- **External calls / dependencies:** None on the landing page (nav/footer loaders only). Wallet/on-chain interaction happens later on `/deploy`.
- **Success state:** User clicks through to `/deploy`.
- **Empty / error states:** Static page; the wallet gate is on the destination, not here.
- **Step count:** 2 required (+0 optional) — primarily content with a wallet-gated downstream action.
