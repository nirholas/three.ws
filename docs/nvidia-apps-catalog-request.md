# NVIDIA Inception catalog request and response record

The outbound Accelerated Apps Catalog request, NVIDIA's 2026-09-14 disposition, the portal
work it requires, a focused reply for the two unanswered asks, and the assets behind each
claim.

The Inception portal has no "publish to the catalog" control. A product record makes the company eligible; the public [Accelerated Apps Catalog](https://marketplace.nvidia.com/en-us/enterprise/applications/) is curated and published by NVIDIA. This email is the request that asks for the listing, and it carries four other asks that have never been made. Per [nvidia-visibility-map.md](./nvidia-visibility-map.md), every Tier 1 ask routes to the same inbox, so they are batched here deliberately. **Do not split these into separate emails.** A program manager who receives one clear email with five asks answers it. Five separate emails read as noise.

- **To:** inceptionprogram@nvidia.com
- **Subject:** three.ws (Inception member): catalog listing, Showcase, and co-marketing
- **From:** the address on the Inception portal account
- **Sent:** 2026-09-04, 2:20 PM, from support@three.ws.
- **Answered:** 2026-09-14, 11:39 AM. NVIDIA confirmed the portal-record criteria for
  periodic catalog review, restored access to the co-branded asset benefit, supplied the
  technical-resource routes, and confirmed that the GTC Startup Pavilion is invite-only.
  The old 2026-09-25 no-response follow-up is cancelled.

## What the reply changed

NVIDIA did not supply another catalog application. It said the periodically reviewed
product record must show runtime NVIDIA use, Development Stage **Shipping**, accurate
Currently Used and Considering selections, supporting Product Description and Technical
Details, a product logo, and a brand color. All copy and assets are now mapped field by
field in [nvidia-apps-catalog-listing.md](./nvidia-apps-catalog-listing.md).

The co-marketing page is available at
`Inception portal > Benefits > Co-Branded Marketing Assets`. Downloading its current badge,
social kits, event assets, and guidelines is now an owner action rather than something
pending on NVIDIA.

NVIDIA also confirmed that the GTC Startup Pavilion is exclusive and invite-only. A current
profile, a demo that makes the NVIDIA acceleration obvious, and active NVIDIA connections
are the selection signals. Stop looking for a Pavilion form; the public CFP remains a
separate speaking/poster route.

Two original asks were not directly answered: Startup Showcase routing and an ACE /
digital-human introduction. A focused reply for only those two points is below.

---

## Step 1: fix the portal record now (about 5 minutes)

This should have preceded the request and remains the one catalog blocker on our side. The
email's first two asks are judged against the record, and as last authenticated the record
read as a CUDA consumer rather than a digital-human app. Verified 2026-09-04: still
uncorrected. NVIDIA's 2026-09-14 reply explicitly asked for this evidence in the product
record.

Go to the Inception portal, Products, then Edit on the `three.ws` row.

**Move these from Considering to Technologies Used:**

| Toggle | Evidence it is shipping |
|---|---|
| **Riva** | [api/_lib/asr-nvidia.js](../api/_lib/asr-nvidia.js) (ASR) and [api/_lib/tts-nvidia.js](../api/_lib/tts-nvidia.js) (Magpie TTS), both Riva gRPC over NVCF |
| **Audio2Face** | [api/_lib/a2f-nvidia.js](../api/_lib/a2f-nvidia.js) against `grpc.nvcf.nvidia.com`, browser playback in [src/voice/a2f-player.js](../src/voice/a2f-player.js), live at [/demos/audio2face](https://three.ws/demos/audio2face) |
| **NIM microservices** (if the form offers it as hosted APIs) | `integrate.api.nvidia.com`: Nemotron 3 Super and Nano, Nemotron Nano VL, NV-EmbedQA-E5-v5, NemoGuard 8B |

**Uncheck entirely: DeepVariant NIM.** It is genomics variant calling. It has nothing to do with this product and it weakens category fit with a curator who reads the record.

**Leave under Considering: TensorRT, Triton Inference Server, Omniverse Kit.** The GPU workers are PyTorch plus CUDA today and OpenUSD interop is roadmap. Do not claim them.

**Keep under Used, and add if the form offers them:** CUDA Toolkit, cuDNN, cuBLAS, CUDA Python, NVIDIA Kaolin, nvdiffrast, L4 GPUs, RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell.

Save the record, reopen it to verify the changes persisted, then send the focused reply for
the two unanswered asks below.

## Step 2: the five asks, and why each one is in this email

| # | Ask | Basis |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Accelerated Apps Catalog listing | Curated by NVIDIA; no self-serve route exists |
| 2 | Inception Startup Showcase feature | Member benefit: "member spotlights and story opportunities" |
| 3 | Co-marketing kit and official badge | Member benefit: "official badges, co-branded social content, and customizable assets for events" |
| 4 | Redirect to the ACE / digital-human team | No public intake form found for ACE |
| 5 | GTC Startup Pavilion and other event slots | Pavilion placement is negotiated with the program team, not a CFP submission |

Asks 2 and 3 are entitlements listed on NVIDIA's own [program page](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/startups/), not favors. Ask 3 is the specific unlock for social amplification: NVIDIA's social team can only reshare a post carrying the official badge and `#NVIDIAInception`. Without the kit there is no mechanism for them to amplify anything.

## Step 3: paste this

Plain text, no formatting needed. Every link in it was checked and answered 200 on 2026-09-04.

Hello,

three.ws is an NVIDIA Inception member (accepted July 2026). Our product
record is filed in the portal as Shipping / GPU Accelerated. I have five
requests, batched into one email rather than five.


1. ACCELERATED APPS CATALOG

I would like to request consideration for the Accelerated Apps Catalog.

What it is: three.ws is a browser-native platform for generating 3D avatars
and AI agents from a prompt. Text, image, or sketch input becomes a textured,
auto-rigged GLB in seconds, and the resulting agent can talk, lip-sync, and be
embedded on any site with one script tag. Free text-to-3D at
https://three.ws/forge, no signup.

Why it belongs in the catalog: the whole product is NVIDIA accelerated
computing end to end, in two layers.

Self-hosted: eight GPU workers on Google Cloud Run, twelve service deployments
across two regions, eleven on NVIDIA L4 and one on RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell.
They are built on nvidia/cuda 12.1 to 12.8 images with custom-compiled CUDA
extensions (nvdiffrast, diffoctreerast, diff-gaussian-rasterization,
torchmcubes) and NVIDIA Kaolin, and they run Hunyuan3D 2.1 and TRELLIS for
image-to-3D, TripoSG for sketch-to-3D, TripoSR for fast drafts,
Make-It-Animatable for auto-rigging, and Motion Diffusion Model for
text-to-motion. The heavy image-to-3D lane is validated on RTX PRO 6000
Blackwell with sm_120 kernel builds.

NVIDIA-hosted: TRELLIS on NVCF is our default free text-to-3D lane. Nemotron 3
Super and Nano power agent reasoning, Nemotron Nano VL handles vision,
NV-EmbedQA-E5-v5 and Mistral reranking power agent memory, NemoGuard 8B gates
every public publish, Riva Magpie TTS and Riva ASR give agents a voice, and
Audio2Face-3D drives real-time ARKit blendshape facial animation in the
browser (live demo: https://three.ws/demos/audio2face).

Public engineering work on the stack:

- Image-to-3D on NVIDIA L4 and Blackwell (memory ceilings, sm_120 kernels,
  regional GPU quota):
  https://three.ws/blog/image-to-3d-on-nvidia-l4-and-blackwell
- How Nemotron made our text-to-3D pipeline usable, posted to the NVIDIA
  Developer Forums:
  https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/how-nemotron-made-three-ws-text-to-3d-pipeline-usable/376445
- How we translate the app into 100 languages with NVIDIA NIM, also on the
  Developer Forums:
  https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/how-three-ws-translates-a-web-app-into-100-languages-with-nvidia-nim-an-llm-powered-i18n-pipeline/377379
- Our full NVIDIA integration map, model by model:
  https://three.ws/docs/nvidia-models

Suggested categorization: Industry, Media and Entertainment. Workload,
Generative AI and Digital Humans. Type, SaaS web application.

If anything else is needed for the listing (logo, screenshots, a longer
description, a specific form), tell me the format and I will send it the same
day. Brand assets and a press kit are ready at
https://three.ws/brand/three-ws-press-kit.zip and I can supply 1920x1080
captures of the generation flow on request.


2. INCEPTION STARTUP SHOWCASE

The program page describes member spotlights and story opportunities through
the Inception Startup Showcase. I would like to put three.ws forward for
consideration.

The story we would tell is the one in the engineering posts above: a small team
running a self-hosted NVIDIA GPU fleet plus NVIDIA-hosted models to make 3D
agent generation fast enough and cheap enough to give away for free in a
browser, with no signup. If a written profile, a founder interview, or a
specific template is the format you need, tell me which and I will turn it
around the same week.


3. CO-MARKETING ASSETS

The program page lists official badges, co-branded social content, and
customizable event assets as a member benefit. We have never requested the kit,
and as a result our Inception membership has never been announced on our own
channels, because we would rather announce it correctly the first time.

Please send the current co-marketing kit and the badge usage guidelines. I want
to confirm the correct badge lockup, the required attribution wording, and
which handle to tag for digital-human content before we post anything.


4. A REDIRECT TO THE ACE / DIGITAL-HUMAN TEAM

I could not find a public intake route for the ACE team, so I am asking here
for a redirect.

We are running Audio2Face-3D in a browser tab. The client streams 16 kHz mono
16-bit PCM into the ACE A2FControllerService over NVCF gRPC and renders the
returned ARKit blendshape track against a WebGL avatar, mapping ARKit-52 onto
whatever morph convention the user's own model ships (ARKit, VRM vowels,
Oculus visemes), alongside Riva ASR in and Magpie TTS out. Live and public, no
install and no signup: https://three.ws/demos/audio2face

To be precise about what we are claiming: we consume ACE microservices as
hosted APIs. We do not self-host NIM. Most A2F work we have seen lives in
Unreal or Omniverse, so a browser-native implementation seemed worth putting in
front of the team that owns it, whether that is useful as a reference
integration, a feedback channel, or neither.


5. GTC STARTUP PAVILION AND OTHER EVENTS

I understand the GTC 2026 call for submissions has closed, and that Pavilion
placement is arranged with the program team rather than through the CFP. Two
questions:

- Is there a route to the Inception Startup Pavilion for the next GTC in San
  Jose, and when does that conversation normally start? I would also like to
  know when the call for submissions is expected to open so we do not miss it.
- The program materials mention Inception exposure at Oracle AI World, KubeCon,
  Supercomputing, Microsoft Ignite, AWS re:Invent, and NeurIPS. Which of those
  carry startup slots we would be eligible for, and what are their lead times?

I would rather ask now and plan around the real dates than miss a window by a
month.


Thank you,

Nicholas

## Attachments

None are required; every asset is linked in the body and the links are live. Attach only if you prefer the curator not to have to click:

- Logo mark: [public/brand/three-ws-mark.png](../public/brand/three-ws-mark.png)
- Lockups: [three-ws-lockup-on-dark.png](../public/brand/three-ws-lockup-on-dark.png), [three-ws-lockup-on-light.png](../public/brand/three-ws-lockup-on-light.png)
- Press kit (6.3 MB, may trip attachment limits; the link in the body is safer): [public/brand/three-ws-press-kit.zip](../public/brand/three-ws-press-kit.zip)

Screenshots were deliberately not attached to the original email. Catalog-ready 1920x1080
captures were prepared on 2026-09-14 for the next touch:

Lead with the NVIDIA product page and Audio2Face images. The Forge capture includes token
holder controls and is supporting product evidence rather than the lead NVIDIA image.

## Focused reply for the two unanswered asks

Send this in the existing thread after the portal record is corrected. Do not send the old
no-response follow-up and do not repeat questions NVIDIA already answered.

```text
Hello,

Thank you. This clarifies the catalog review path, the restored co-branded asset
benefit, and the invite-only GTC Pavilion process. We are updating the Shipping
product record with the runtime technologies, supporting Product Description and
Technical Details, logo, and brand color, and will keep the record and demo current.

Two questions from my original note remain:

1. Is Inception Startup Showcase consideration also driven by the product record,
or is there a separate nomination step?
2. Could you point me to the appropriate ACE / digital-human contact for our
browser-native Audio2Face-3D and Riva implementation?

The live, no-install demo is https://three.ws/demos/audio2face and the complete
runtime map is https://three.ws/docs/nvidia-models.

Thank you,

Nicholas

## After you send

1. Send date recorded in the **Sent** field at the top of this doc.
2. Correct the main product record with every field NVIDIA named, then file the second
   product record, the `<agent-3d>` digital-human embed. Copy is ready in
   [nvidia-apps-catalog-listing.md](./nvidia-apps-catalog-listing.md) under "Second product
   record".
3. Download and review the current kit from
   `Portal > Benefits > Co-Branded Marketing Assets` before posting.
4. Send the focused two-question reply above.
5. Route each later reply:

| Reply | Where it goes next |
|---|---|
| Catalog information or asset request | Answer same day. Everything is in [nvidia-apps-catalog-listing.md](./nvidia-apps-catalog-listing.md). |
| Showcase interest | Draft the profile against the engineering posts, not marketing copy. |
| Co-marketing kit changes | Reconcile the current badge/guidelines, then use the owner-gated copy in [marketing/nvidia-inception/social-copy.md](../marketing/nvidia-inception/social-copy.md). |
| ACE redirect | The forum post 3 draft, [nvidia-forum-browser-digital-human.md](./nvidia-forum-browser-digital-human.md), is the technical brief to send them. |
| GTC invitation or CFP dates | Record the invitation directly; keep public CFP dates in [nvidia-visibility-map.md](./nvidia-visibility-map.md) without conflating the two routes. |
| No reply to the two focused questions | Keep building public technical proof; do not restart the five-ask thread. |

## Verification log

Checked 2026-09-04 before this packet was finalized:

- Every URL in the email body returned HTTP 200, including both Developer Forums posts, the blog post, the demo, the docs pages, and the press kit.
- The Riva, Audio2Face, and NIM claims were re-read against the code they cite. A2F still targets `nvidia_ace.services.a2f_controller.v1.A2FControllerService` on `grpc.nvcf.nvidia.com:443` at 16 kHz mono, matching the wording in ask 4.
- The text-to-image lane is FLUX.1-dev, not schnell (the hosted schnell preview was retired). FLUX is not claimed in this email, so no change was needed here.
- The GPU fleet count (eight workers, twelve deployments, eleven L4, one RTX PRO 6000) is carried over from the 2026-09-02 live recount. `gcloud` credentials in the dev container had expired, so it was not re-run today. To refresh before sending: `gcloud run services list --project aerial-vehicle-466722-p5 --format="csv[no-heading](metadata.name,spec.template.spec.nodeSelector)" | grep -i accelerator`
