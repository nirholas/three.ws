# The home relay: threat model

**What an attacker gets, at every position around the socket a LAN-only house dials out through,
and what stops them.**

This is the document [`services/home-relay/src/server.js`](../services/home-relay/src/server.js),
[`protocol.js`](../services/home-relay/src/protocol.js) and
[`api/home/pair.js`](../api/home/pair.js) tell you to read before changing them. It covers the
relay specifically. The platform-wide model, the prompt-injection boundary and the abuse surface
are in [home-security.md](home-security.md).

## What the relay is

Most Home Assistant installs answer only on their own network. three.ws is served over https from
Cloud Run and cannot route to RFC1918 space, so for those houses there is no URL we could ever
dial. The house dials us instead: the three.ws integration inside it opens **one outbound
WebSocket** to [`services/home-relay`](../services/home-relay/README.md) and keeps it. The
platform then asks the relay to open a session over that socket.

Nothing listens on the user's network. No port is forwarded. No inbound firewall rule exists.

```
  three.ws api  ──WS /v1/bridge──►  home-relay  ◄──WS /v1/agent──  Home Assistant
   (platform)                     (this service)                    (the house)
```

## The design decision the whole model rests on

**The obvious implementation would be the worst thing this platform could ship.** "Forward any
HTTP request into the LAN" is a caller-chosen path into somebody's home network, and no amount of
authentication makes that safe, because the authenticated caller is exactly who you have to worry
about once anything upstream is compromised.

So the relay is not a proxy. It carries a **fixed, enumerated set** of Home Assistant WebSocket
message types and refuses everything else. The set is derived from what
[`packages/home-bridge`](../packages/home-bridge/README.md) actually sends, which is what the
product's three channels need: the entity subscription, four registry reads, and service calls.
Nothing else has ever been needed, so nothing else is permitted.

## The five positions, and what each one gets

### 1. A stranger on the internet

Gets nothing. There is no inbound path to the house at all, and the relay's own endpoints require
either a signed install token (`/v1/agent`) or the platform's service token (`/v1/bridge`).

### 2. Someone who steals an install token

An install token (`hr1.<payload>.<hmac>`, see [`token.js`](../services/home-relay/src/token.js))
identifies which house is dialling in. It is minted by three.ws at pairing time, stored by the
integration, and presented on every dial-in. The relay verifies the HMAC with the shared signing
key and reads the relay id out of the payload, so it stays **stateless about ownership**: it never
queries a database on the connect path, and it cannot be tricked into binding a socket to a relay
id its holder was not granted.

A stolen token gets an attacker a socket to the relay. It does not get them a house:

- The relay only ever joins that socket to **the owning user's own sessions**.
- The physical-action gate still sits above every one of those sessions, so a guarded action still
  needs a person.
- The token is **not** a Home Assistant credential. In relay mode three.ws stores no Home
  Assistant token at all (`home_connections.access_token_enc` is empty), because the integration
  authenticates to Home Assistant locally with a refresh token it mints for itself and never sends
  off the machine.

Revocation is push-based and immediate: three.ws calls `POST /v1/revoke` when a home is revoked,
the relay drops the socket and denies the relay id. The token deliberately carries no expiry the
user would have to re-pair around, because it is not the last line of defence: the platform
re-reads the connection row on every bridge connect, so a revoked home never gets a session opened
even if the relay were to forget the denial.

### 3. A compromised or buggy platform-side caller

This is the position the allowlist in the relay exists for. Even holding the service token, a
platform caller can send only the enumerated outbound types, and:

- `subscribe_events` is limited to a closed list: `state_changed` plus the four
  `area_registry_updated`, `device_registry_updated`, `entity_registry_updated` and
  `floor_registry_updated` announcements the room graph rebuilds from. Anything else "would
  subscribe to more of the house than the room graph needs", and is refused by name. A bare
  `subscribe_events`, which would carry every event in the house including other integrations'
  service calls, is refused too. The registry events widen nothing: each is a notice that a
  registry changed, and the full contents of all four registries are already readable through the
  `config/*_registry/list` calls on the same list.
- `call_service` is refused outright for `shell_command`, `python_script`, `hassio`, `supervisor`,
  `backup`, `update`, `cloud`, `config`, `auth` and `command_line`, plus the named services that
  survive a permitted domain: `homeassistant.restart`, `homeassistant.stop`,
  `homeassistant.check_config`, `homeassistant.reload_all`, `homeassistant.reload_core_config`,
  `persistent_notification.create`.
- Only `result`, `event` and `pong` come back out of a house.

Rate limits are per install and cover both frame rate and actuation rate (40 outbound frames per
second, 60 service calls per minute, 8 concurrent sessions, 4 MB per frame): a bug in an
integration must not be able to flood a house, and a compromised platform caller must not be able
to hammer a lock.

### 4. A compromised relay

**This is the position that matters most, because the relay is operated by us and is therefore
exactly the component a user has to trust least.**

The allowlist is enforced **twice, independently**: once in the relay
([`server.js`](../services/home-relay/src/server.js)) so a bad platform caller cannot reach past
it, and again in the integration inside the house (`relay_client.py`) so a bad relay cannot
either. Compromising the relay does not widen what may enter a house by one message type.

Both enforcement points read the same enumeration rather than transcribing it:
[`protocol.js`](../services/home-relay/src/protocol.js) is the source of truth,
[`allowlist.json`](../services/home-relay/allowlist.json) is the generated copy the Python side
reads, and `tests/home-relay-protocol.test.js` fails if the checked-in copy is stale. Two
enforcement points that drift apart would be worse than one.

The relay also holds nothing worth stealing: no database, no Home Assistant credential, and no
persistent record of what passed through it.

**What it does still get, and this is the honest cost of the feature.** An attacker with the relay
holds live sockets into every house connected at that moment, and the allowlist permits device
service calls. So they can read entity state and the room, area, device and floor registries of
every connected house, and they can turn on lights, open covers, disarm alarms and unlock locks.
They cannot run code on any Home Assistant host, restart or reconfigure any instance, read any
Home Assistant credential, reach any other service on any LAN, reach a house that is not currently
connected, or persist anything.

The gate stops a *model* from opening a house; it does not stop somebody who owns the relay,
because the gate lives on the platform side and they are past it. What still applies is the
per-install actuation limit (60 service calls a minute) and Home Assistant's own logbook, which
records every service call with its source in a place we cannot edit.

**If that is not acceptable to you, do not use relay mode.** A remote https URL removes the relay
from the path entirely; it also requires handing three.ws a long-lived Home Assistant token, which
relay mode never does. Neither is strictly safer. They trade different risks, and this document
exists so the trade is made knowingly rather than discovered later.

### 5. Someone inside the house

Out of scope, and honestly so. Anyone with access to the Home Assistant instance can already do
everything the relay could ever ask for, directly, without us.

## What is deliberately accepted

- **The relay sees traffic in transit.** It terminates both sockets, so it can read the state and
  service calls that cross it. It cannot read a Home Assistant credential, because none crosses,
  and it cannot widen the message set, because the far end enforces the list again. Encrypting
  end to end past the relay would require the integration and the platform to share a key the
  relay never sees, which is worth doing and is not done today.
- **The install token has no expiry.** See position 2 for why: revocation is push-based and the
  platform re-checks the connection row on every session.
- **A house can lie about its own state.** An instance that reports a door as locked when it is
  not is a compromised house, and no relay design fixes that.
- **The MCP channel does not run over the relay.** `connectHomeMcp` speaks streamable HTTP to
  `/api/mcp` with a bearer token, and a relayed home has neither a URL nor a token, so relayed
  homes report `capabilities.mcp === false` and use the WebSocket channel. That is every feature
  except the user's own curated MCP tool list. Carrying it would widen the allowlist, so it needs
  its own review rather than an extension.
- **The relay is one trust domain.** A single process holds every house. Sessions are keyed by a
  random 12-byte id inside a per-install map and the routing is tested, but a bug that crossed
  sessions would cross houses, and that should be said out loud rather than left implied by the
  architecture diagram.
- **The relay build is not attested.** Trusting relay mode includes trusting that the deployed
  relay is the code in this repository. Reproducible builds and image signing would close that gap
  and are not done.

## What is logged, and what deliberately is not

The relay emits one structured JSON line per event: relay id, agent name and version, session ids,
counters, and the coded reason for every refusal including the message **type** refused. It never
logs the contents of a Home Assistant message, an entity name, a state value, an install token, a
service token, or a pairing code.

`home_action_log` on the platform records every write against a house, and a relayed action is
logged identically to a direct one: the same actor, channel, resolved entity ids, guarded flag,
confirming human, risk and outcome. The transport does not appear in that table and does not need
to, because it changes nothing about what happened.

## Operational requirements

| Requirement | Why |
|---|---|
| `HOME_RELAY_SIGNING_KEY` and `HOME_RELAY_SERVICE_TOKEN` in Secret Manager, never env literals | They are the two secrets the whole system rests on. The relay refuses to start if either is under 32 characters. |
| Rotating `HOME_RELAY_SIGNING_KEY` un-pairs every house | Every install token is an HMAC under it. Treat rotation as incident response, not maintenance. |
| The relay must run unthrottled with at least one warm instance | It holds sockets between requests; a throttled or cold instance drops every connected house into a reconnect loop at once. |
| `--allow-unauthenticated` on the relay is correct, not a mistake | Houses dial in from the public internet with their own bearer token, and the service authenticates every connection itself. IAM auth would make the feature impossible rather than safer. |

## Verifying these claims

Nothing above is a description of intent. Each claim has a runnable check:

```bash
# The allowlist, exhaustively, with no network:
npx vitest run tests/home-relay-protocol.test.js

# The relay, the transport, revocation, token binding and the limits, in process:
npx vitest run tests/home-relay-transport.test.js

# Pairing single-use, expiry, attempt limits and per-home token binding:
DATABASE_URL=... npx vitest run tests/home-relay-pairing.test.js

# The whole path against a real Home Assistant on a network the caller cannot
# route to. The two-network recipe is in docs/home-relay.md, and the script
# refuses to report success if the house turns out to be reachable directly:
docker run --rm --network cloud-net --add-host relay.host:host-gateway \
  -v "$PWD:/app" -w /app node:24-slim \
  node scripts/home-relay-e2e.mjs --relay ws://relay.host:8899 \
    --relay-id <id> --service-token <token> --unroutable http://<ha ip>:8123
```

Measured on 2026-09-03, from a container with no route to the house:

```
PASS  the house is genuinely unreachable from here
      direct fetch of http://172.20.0.2:8123 failed after 6002 ms, as it must
PASS  connected through the relay
      159 ms, transport=relay, rooms=3, entities=121
PASS  an unconfirmed unlock is refused over the relay
      needs_confirmation: "unlock" on lock.front_door cannot be safely undone remotely.
PASS  the relay refuses a message type outside the allowlist
      not_allowed: "get_services" is not a message type this relay carries into a home.
PASS  the relay refuses a service call that would run code on the house
      not_allowed: The "shell_command" domain administers the Home Assistant install
PASS  the same raw channel still carries an allowlisted message
      get_config -> location_name=Home
```

## The invariant

**Nothing on this path may open a building without a person.** The relay does not implement the
gate, and it must never be given a way to bypass one: a service call arriving over `/v1/bridge`
has already been through
[`api/_lib/home/tools.js`](../api/_lib/home/tools.js) and, if guarded, has already been redeemed
by a signed-in human at `POST /api/home/:id/confirm`. If a change to this service would let a call
reach a house without having passed that, the change is wrong.
