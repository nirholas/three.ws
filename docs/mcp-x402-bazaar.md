# three.ws x402 Bazaar — MCP server

Discover paid agent services across the **live x402 facilitator network** —
search, browse, and price any service from inside Claude, Cursor, or any MCP
client. Registered with the MCP Registry as
**`io.github.nirholas/threews-x402-bazaar`**.

- **Endpoint:** `https://three.ws/api/mcp-bazaar`
- **Transport:** Streamable HTTP (MCP `2025-06-18`)
- **Auth:** OAuth 2.1 (same three.ws authorization server as `/api/mcp`) or x402
- **Data:** live `/discovery/resources` from the configured x402 facilitators — no cached or synthetic listings

## Tools

| Tool | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| `search_services(query, type?, network?, max_price_usdc?, limit?)` | Ranked search over the merged facilitator catalog. |
| `browse_services(type?, network?, max_price_usdc?, limit?)` | List services without a query — "what can I pay for?". |
| `get_service(resource_url, tool_name?)` | Full payment requirements (price, asset, network, recipient), input/output schema, and a ready pay link. |
| `bazaar_service_details(resource_url, tool_name?)` | Live price only: cheapest across networks plus a per-network breakdown. Built for price tracking on a schedule. |
| `read_resource(uri?, format?)` | Read a live three.ws resource by URI: `three://x402/services` (the x402 service catalog), `three://marketplace` (paid agent skills and services) and `three://me`. Omit `uri` to list every resource you can read; `format: "markdown"` renders it for reading. |
| `getting_started(section?)` | Free, no auth or payment. An overview of the server, its tools, and how to connect. Call this first. |

`type` is `http` (paid HTTP APIs) or `mcp` (paid MCP tools). `network` is a
CAIP-2 id, e.g. `eip155:8453` (Base) or `solana:*`. `max_price_usdc` filters to
services at or below a dollar ceiling.

### Tracking a service's price over time

`bazaar_service_details` is the one to poll. It returns the same
`structuredContent` shape whether or not the service is still listed, so a
tracker can diff two samples field by field without special-casing a
disappearance:

```json
{
  "service_key": "https://api.example.com/weather",
  "available": true,
  "networks": ["eip155:8453"],
  "min_price_atomic": 1000,
  "min_price_label": "0.001 USDC",
  "prices": [
    {
      "network": "eip155:8453",
      "amount_atomic": 1000,
      "price": "0.001 USDC",
      "asset": "0xUSDCassetAddressOnThisNetwork",
      "pay_to": "0xServiceRecipientAddress",
      "scheme": "exact"
    }
  ]
}
```

A service that has dropped off every facilitator is not an error: it comes back
with the same keys, `available: false`, an empty `prices`, and `null` for both
price fields. `min_price_label` is `null` (never absent) in both branches, so a
missing label and a missing sample stay distinguishable.

Use `get_service` instead when you also need the input/output schema and a pay
link. `bazaar_service_details` deliberately omits both to stay cheap to poll.

## Use on claude.ai

Add the connector with URL `https://three.ws/api/mcp-bazaar` and complete OAuth.
Then:

> "Find me a cheap weather API I can pay for, on Base."

Claude calls `search_services`, then `get_service` for the top hit, and shows
the price, the network, and a one-click pay link.

## Paying

The bazaar is a **discovery** surface. `get_service` returns the exact x402
payment requirements plus a `pay_link` to the three.ws hosted payer
(`/pay`), which settles the payment with your three.ws agent wallet and returns
the service response.

Autonomous in-MCP `pay_and_call` (the server pays and calls on your behalf) is a
deliberate, wallet-gated extension — it spends real funds, so it ships only
behind explicit per-user wallet authorization rather than being enabled for any
connected client by default.

## Configuration

Facilitators come from the platform default set (`defaultFacilitators()` in
`api/_lib/x402/bazaar-client.js`); no extra env is required to read the bazaar.
Discovery is rate-limited to 60 calls/min per principal to bound facilitator
egress.
