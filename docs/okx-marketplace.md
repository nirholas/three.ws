# OKX.AI Marketplace Services

three.ws sells 3D generation to other AI agents on [OKX.AI](https://web3.okx.com), OKX's
on-chain agent marketplace. Buyers are agents: they discover a service, receive an HTTP 402
payment challenge, pay in stablecoins on X Layer (or USDC on our other x402 rails), and get
the artifact. Our marketplace entry is agent **#2632 "three.ws 3D Studio"**.

> **Listing state, read live 2026-09-09: rejected, awaiting resubmission.** The line-up below

> rejected it on 2026-09-03 over the payment leg: an OKX agentic wallet is an EIP-7702 delegated
> EOA and our verifier refused its signature. That is fixed and live (2026-09-05 release), OKX's

**What we list, as of 2026-08-22: three.ws Forge.** The listing was rebuilt around one
thing done extremely well, turning a description into a real 3D model, because that is the
capability agents actually ask for and it is the smallest surface a reviewer has to trust.
An OKX.AI agent gets exactly what the "three.ws 3D Studio" custom GPT gives a ChatGPT user
(a GLB, a concept image, a browser viewer link, and an AR link that puts the model in a
real room), over the marketplace's own payment rail. Everything else we built for OKX.AI
(the Agent Identity Studio and the specialist rigging/retargeting/export endpoints) is on
the **back burner**: still deployed, still payable, deliberately off the listing. Those are
documented at the bottom of this page.

> [x402 payments](./x402.md) · seller-side protocol spec:
> [`specs/okx-agent-payments.md`](../specs/okx-agent-payments.md)

The **single source of truth** for every service (names, OKX listing copy, prices,
endpoints, input schemas, and which rows are listed) is
[`api/_lib/okx-catalog.js`](../api/_lib/okx-catalog.js). The free catalog endpoint below
serves it verbatim and the listing submission is generated from it, so the docs and the
endpoints cannot drift apart. The rows OKX stores are the one copy that is not automatic:
they only change when an `agent update` is submitted, so `npm run okx:three-copy` compares
them against the module and fails on the difference rather than letting it go unnoticed.

### The A2MCP listing description format

OKX listing QA requires **four** newline-separated parts on an A2MCP service and rejects a
listing missing any of them (the contract is stated in `onchainos agent update --help`).
Submitting two parts is what earned the standing review remark on agent #2632: "The service
you submitted is missing a complete description, parameter details, and usage examples."

| Part | Content | Where it comes from |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | What the service does | `describes.capability` |
| 2 | Every parameter on ONE line, `;`-separated, each `<name> (<type>, required/optional): <meaning>` | generated from `inputSchema` + `describes.params` |
| 3 | Request method (`POST`/`GET`, plus the MCP tool name where there is one) | generated from `kind` + `tool` |
| 4 | A working `curl` against the real endpoint | generated from `endpoint` + `describes.example` |

Parts 2 and 4 are **derived, never hand-written**: `parameterSpec()` reads the row's own
JSON Schema, so a renamed argument renames itself in the listing, and `requestExample()`
builds the call from example arguments that the test suite validates against that same
schema. A published example the endpoint would reject cannot ship. `validateCatalog()`
fails any listed row whose schema and documented parameters disagree, whose description is
not four non-empty parts, or which exceeds OKX's 2000 half-width cap.

Back-burner rows (`listed: false`) are held to the catalog rules only; they pick up the
four-part rules when they return to the listing.

## three.ws Forge

Four paid services and one free one. Every row is a real **A2MCP** endpoint: MCP Streamable
HTTP, JSON-RPC 2.0 over `POST`, session terminate on `DELETE` (204). The paid tool answers an
unpaid call with an OKX-dialect 402 whose `accepts[]` **leads with `eip155:196`**, which is
the OKX Agent Payments Protocol integration the review asked for.

`POST` is the whole transport here: these servers hold no server-to-client stream, so a `GET`
is not an SSE session. On a paid row it answers the same 402 challenge (verified 2026-09-02:
`GET /api/okx/3d/forge-draft` is 402 with or without `Accept: text/event-stream`), and on a
free row it answers **405** with `Allow: POST, DELETE`, which is what the approved sellers on
this marketplace answer too. Discover a row by reading the free catalog, or by calling
`getting_started` over `POST`.

| Service | Price (USDT) | Endpoint | You send |
|---|---|---|---|
| Forge 3D Draft | $0.01 | `/api/okx/3d/forge-draft` | `prompt` |
| Forge 3D Standard | $0.05 | `/api/okx/3d/forge-standard` | `prompt` |
| Forge 3D HD | $0.25 | `/api/okx/3d/forge-hd` | `prompt` |
| Forge 3D from Image | $0.25 | `/api/okx/3d/forge-image` | `image_urls[]` |
| Forge Job Status | free | `/api/okx/3d/forge-status` | `job_id` |

The four paid rows differ **only** in generation lane and price. OKX prices a service, not
a parameter, so a quality tier has to be its own row to carry its own fee. Your client code
is identical across all of them: every endpoint exposes the same three tools.

| Tool | Cost | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `forge_3d` | the row's price | Starts a generation, returns a `job` handle |
| `forge_status` | free | Polls any three.ws forge job, returns the finished links |
| `getting_started` | free | Overview of the server, its tools, prices, and links |

`forge_status` lives on every endpoint, so you poll a job where you paid for it and never
have to discover a second host mid-flight. It is also listed as its own free service, so an
agent can hold one status endpoint for jobs started anywhere.

### 1 · Start a generation (paid)

An unpaid call returns the 402 challenge; pay it (`onchainos payment pay --payload '<402
body>'` on OKX rails, or any x402 client) and replay with the payment header.

```bash
curl -sS -X POST https://three.ws/api/okx/3d/forge-standard \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -H 'PAYMENT-SIGNATURE: <the header your x402 client returned>' \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1, "method": "tools/call",
    "params": {
      "name": "forge_3d",
      "arguments": { "prompt": "a low-poly orange fox sitting down" }
    }
  }'
```

Arguments for the three text rows:

| Field | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `prompt` | yes | 3 to 1000 characters, one subject, its style and key colours |
| `aspect_ratio` | no | `1:1`, `4:3`, `3:4`, `16:9`, `9:16` |

`forge-image` takes `image_urls` (1 to 4 `https://` links to views of the same subject)
plus an optional `prompt` that sharpens the reconstruction.

A queued job returns:

```json
{
  "ok": true, "service": "forge-standard", "status": "pending",
  "job": "f1.…", "poll_tool": "forge_status",
  "poll_endpoint": "https://three.ws/api/okx/3d/forge-status",
  "poll_arguments": { "job_id": "f1.…", "title": "a low-poly orange fox sitting down" },
  "watchUrl": "https://three.ws/watch?job=…", "format": "glb", "etaSeconds": 45
}
```

Copy `poll_arguments` verbatim into the next `forge_status` call. The `title` is optional; if
you drop it, the status service recovers it from the job itself.

A fast lane can finish inline instead, in which case you get the `done` body below with no
polling at all.

### 2 · Poll the job (free)

```bash
curl -sS -X POST https://three.ws/api/okx/3d/forge-status \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 2, "method": "tools/call",
    "params": { "name": "forge_status", "arguments": { "job_id": "f1.…" } }
  }'
```

Poll every few seconds. When `status` is `"done"`:

```json
{
  "ok": true, "status": "done", "job": "f1.…",
  "glbUrl": "https://…/model.glb",
  "viewerUrl": "https://three.ws/viewer?src=…",
  "arUrl": "https://three.ws/api/ar?src=…",
  "pageUrl": "https://three.ws/m/0b6d2a9e-…",
  "previewImageUrl": "https://…/concept.png",
  "format": "glb", "tier": "standard"
}
```

The text content of the same response lists every one of those links on its own line, so an
agent that relays tool text to a human without reading `structuredContent` still hands over
the viewer, the AR launch and the page.

- `glbUrl` is the model itself, a real glTF binary you can download, open in any glTF
  runtime, or embed.
- `viewerUrl` opens it in a browser, spinning, on any device.
- `arUrl` is the device-aware AR launch: Scene Viewer on Android, Quick Look on iOS
  (GLB to USDZ converted in-page), the WebGL viewer on desktop. This is the link that puts
  the model in a human's actual room, which is usually what an agent's user wanted.
- `pageUrl` is the model's public page: the model spinning in a viewer with AR and
  fullscreen, download, embed code, share, comments and likes. It is the one link to hand a
  human when they should get everything.
- `previewImageUrl` is the painted concept view the forge produces before the mesh, so you
  can show something the moment it exists.

A failed job answers `status: "error"` with an actionable message and, when the generator can
name them, `retryBackends`: the alternate engines that can still serve this request. The lane
exhausts its own backend failover chain before it ever reports a failure, so an `error` frame
is terminal for that job. **A retry is a new paid call**: these rows settle when the lane
accepts a job (see Payment semantics below), so a job that fails during generation has been
charged. Over the 30 days to 2026-09-02, 255 of 10,278 forge jobs (2.5%) ended `failed` after
acceptance.

### Payment semantics

Each guarantee below is enforced in code (`verify → dispatch → settle-on-success`, in
[`api/okx/3d/[service].js`](../api/okx/3d/%5Bservice%5D.js)) and covered by the endpoint's
unit tests in [`tests/api/okx-forge.test.js`](../tests/api/okx-forge.test.js).

- **You pay only when the job is accepted.** Input validation and the age-13+ content gate
  run before settlement; a rejected prompt or a malformed argument fails the call and
  **no payment settles**. Acceptance is the line: once the lane takes the job the payment
  settles, so a failure that happens later, during generation, has been charged and a retry
  is a new paid call. Nothing here refunds after settlement.
- **HD means HD.** If the high-detail lane will not take a job, `forge-hd` answers
  `tier_unavailable` (with `charged: false` and a `retry_after`) instead of quietly serving
  a standard mesh at the HD price. That refusal is also before settlement.
- **Delivery has to be up before you are charged.** A finished mesh reaches you only once
  it has been copied into the delivery bucket, so a paid row checks that the bucket is
  writable before it hands the job to the generator. If it is not, the call answers
  `delivery_unavailable` (with `charged: false` and a `retry_after`) rather than accepting,
  settling, and leaving you polling a job that can never reach `done`. The check is cached
  and fails open on a transient fault, so only a credential that is deterministically
  rejected or missing stops the row selling.
- **A real MCP client gets a 402.** The shared three.ws MCP servers answer OAuth-capable
  clients (`Accept: text/event-stream`, `mcp-protocol-version`) with a 401 so they can
  discover OAuth. The OKX.AI endpoints never do: every unpaid paid-tool call is a 402 with
  the `PAYMENT-REQUIRED` header, whatever the client sends, because the OKX buyer flow keys
  strictly on 402.
- **Polling is free and unlimited**, on every endpoint and on the standalone status
  service.
- **One payment, one job.** The payment proof is single-use across dispatch and settlement
  (replay-guarded), and the settled amount always equals the advertised price.
- **Retried payments are safe.** The same payment plus the same body replays the same
  response through the idempotency cache instead of running a second job.
- **Each rail is advertised once**, and every rail in a service's 402 quotes the same
  amount, derived from the catalog module. That holds for *every* unpaid POST, not just a
  well-formed `tools/call`: a body that names no priced tool (an empty body, a plain
  business payload, a mistyped tool name) is quoted at the row's list price rather than
  falling back to the platform default, so a buyer never reads two prices for one rail.
- **A bare `POST` is answered with the quotation, not a content-type error.** The A2MCP
  guide's compliance self-check is `curl -i -X POST <endpoint>` with no body and no
  `content-type`, and its pass condition for a paid row is `HTTP 402` carrying
  `PAYMENT-REQUIRED`. Every paid row answers it that way. Unparseable bytes from a caller
  that is already past the paywall get the JSON-RPC parse error (`-32700`), and nothing
  settles because nothing ran.
- **Both of those are checked against the live site on demand.**
  `node scripts/okx-compliance-probe.mjs` walks all four paid rows through the reviewer's
  probe shapes (the bodyless self-check, an empty JSON body, a plain business payload, and
  a well-formed priced `tools/call`) and exits non-zero if any 402 goes missing, duplicates
  a rail, or quotes anything but the row's registered list price. Point it elsewhere with
  `--base`, and capture the run with `--out prompts/okx-ai/e2e-evidence/<file>.json`. Run it
  before every listing resubmission.

> **Not yet demonstrated end to end.** The X Layer rail reports `settleable: true` in
> production, but no *funded* call has settled on-chain against these endpoints yet: the
> payer wallet is unfunded, so every real attempt returns `insufficient_balance`. Treat the

## Back burner

These are **not** on the OKX.AI listing and are not part of the current submission. They
remain deployed, priced, tested and payable at the endpoints below, and the free catalog
publishes them under `unlisted` rather than hiding them, because they answer real 402s to
anyone holding the URL. They return to the listing once the forge rows have sales behind
them.

**Agent Identity Studio**, `$1.50`, `/api/okx/3d/identity-studio` (A2MCP). Turns an agent's
brand brief into a complete 3D identity: a square PFP sized for the OKX.AI avatar slot, a
three-pose full-body render set, and the rigged animation-ready GLB. Paid tool
`create_identity`, free `identity_status` polling. Demo identities generated end to end by
this pipeline: [three.ws/agent-identities](https://three.ws/agent-identities).

**Single-capability REST endpoints.** Plain JSON `POST`, one price each, all backed by the
same engines the [MCP 3D studio](./mcp.md) runs. `GET` on any of them returns its free
descriptor (price, description, input schema).

| Service | Price (USDT) | Endpoint | You send |
|---|---|---|---|
| Text → 3D Model (GLB) | $0.01 | `/api/okx/3d/text-to-3d` | `prompt` |
| Text → 3D Model (Pro) | $0.30 | `/api/okx/3d/text-to-3d-pro` | `prompt`, `tier?` |
| Image → 3D Model | $0.30 | `/api/okx/3d/image-to-3d` | `image_urls[]` |
| GLB Auto-Rigging | $0.25 | `/api/okx/3d/rig` | `glb_url` |
| Text → Rigged Avatar | $0.50 | `/api/okx/3d/avatar` | `prompt` or `image_url` |
| Animation Retargeting | $0.10 | `/api/okx/3d/retarget` | `model_url`, `animation` |
| Pose Seed | $0.02 | `/api/okx/3d/pose-seed` | `prompt` |
| FBX Export (rig-preserving) | $0.10 | `/api/okx/3d/fbx-export` | `model_url`, `format?` |

The buyer flow is the same for all of them: unpaid `POST` → 402 → sign
(`onchainos payment pay --payload '<402 body>'`) → replay with `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE`.
Generation-grade services reply `{status:"queued", job_id, poll_url}` and polling
`GET https://three.ws/api/forge?job=<job_id>` is free; fast services (`retarget`,
`pose-seed`) reply `{status:"done", …}` inline. Settlement happens **after** the engine
accepts the job, so invalid input, the avatar humanoid gate, or an engine failure answers
before settlement and never charges.

## Rails

Challenges advertise every rail the deployment can settle: **X Layer (`eip155:196`,
USD₮0)** first for OKX.AI buyers, plus the existing Solana / Base / BSC USDC rails so
non-OKX agents can pay the same endpoint. The wire format OKX buyers use (headers
`PAYMENT-REQUIRED` / `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE` / `PAYMENT-RESPONSE`, scheme `exact` EIP-3009) is
pinned down in [`specs/okx-agent-payments.md`](../specs/okx-agent-payments.md).
