# three.ws 3D Studio — free MCP endpoint

A free, non-crypto MCP server that turns a text prompt or an image into an
interactive, downloadable 3D model (GLB). It exposes **only** 3D-generation
tools — no account, no payment, no API key, no wallet, no token. Built for the
OpenAI ChatGPT App Directory and any MCP client.

> The paid, crypto-enabled studio (per-call USDC via x402) is a separate server
> at `/api/mcp-3d`. This endpoint shares none of that surface.

## Connect

| | |
|---|---|
| **URL** | `https://three.ws/api/mcp-studio` |
| **Transport** | Streamable HTTP (JSON-RPC over `POST`) |
| **Auth** | None — open and free |
| **Protocol** | MCP `2025-06-18` |
| **Manifest** | [`server-studio.json`](../server-studio.json) |

`GET` is intentionally not offered (no server-initiated stream); the server
answers every request synchronously over `POST`. `OPTIONS` is handled for CORS.

### ChatGPT (Apps SDK)

Two front doors serve the same tools over one handler
([`api/_mcp-studio/handler.js`](../api/_mcp-studio/handler.js)) and share one
generation quota:

| URL | Serves | Use it for |
|---|---|---|
| `https://three.ws/api/mcp-studio` | all eleven tools, both widgets | any MCP host, including a ChatGPT developer-mode connector |
| `https://three.ws/api/mcp-chatgpt` | the eight 3D tools and the model viewer | the ChatGPT plugin directory listing |

The ChatGPT surface leaves out the three persona tools because their widget
frames the hosted embodiment page, which needs `frameDomains`. OpenAI's app
guidelines reserve frame domains for embedding an essential third-party
experience and say those apps "are often not approved for broad distribution";
framing our own page is not that case. `SURFACES` in
[`api/_mcp-studio/dispatch.js`](../api/_mcp-studio/dispatch.js) is the single
definition of what each door advertises.

Add either connector with **No authentication**. Each generation tool renders its
result inline in an interactive 3D viewer widget
(`ui://widget/three-studio-model.html`); on `/api/mcp-studio` the persona tools
also render a living agent body in their own widget
(`ui://widget/three-studio-persona.html`). The model viewer's `openai/widgetCSP`
allowlists exactly two origins, `https://three.ws` and the model-viewer CDN,
because the widget re-serves every off-origin GLB through `/api/glb` and every
poster through `/api/img`. ChatGPT enforces that CSP, and its review flags
wildcard or unused domains.

### Any MCP client

```bash
curl -s https://three.ws/api/mcp-studio \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list"}'
```

### ChatGPT custom GPT (Actions)

The same free lane also ships as a REST Actions surface for the **"three.ws 3D
Studio"** custom GPT: `POST /api/3d/studio` submits a prompt and
`GET /api/3d/studio?job=<id>` polls it, with an age-13+ safety gate and
store-clean responses (model URLs and job state only). The machine-readable
contract is the OpenAPI schema the platform serves at
[`https://three.ws/.well-known/3d-studio-openapi.yaml`](../public/.well-known/3d-studio-openapi.yaml),
which is what the custom GPT imports; the same endpoint is written up in prose in
the [API reference](./api-reference.md). Use the MCP connector above when you
want inline 3D widgets; the custom GPT covers plans without connector support.

How AR rides both ChatGPT surfaces (the `arUrl` contract, the device-aware
launcher, living avatars, link unfurls) is documented end to end in
[AR in ChatGPT](./chatgpt-ar.md).

## Tools

`tools/list` returns exactly **eleven** tools, and they split four ways:

- **Six generation tools** (`forge_free`, `text_to_avatar`, `mesh_forge`,
  `rig_mesh`, `forge_avatar`, `refine_model`), in the table below.
- **One collector**, `check_job`, also in the table below.
- **One inspector**, `look_at_model`, also in the table below.
- **Three persona/embodiment tools** (`create_agent_persona`,
  `get_agent_persona`, `persona_say`), in the **Embodiment** section further down.

All eleven are free and keyless.

The six generation tools run operator-funded on the platform's own generation
pipeline. Annotations: `readOnlyHint:false`, `destructiveHint:false`,
`idempotentHint:false`, `openWorldHint:true` (work runs against external model
APIs; nothing is ever modified or deleted). `check_job` reads like a status probe
but is not one, and its annotations say so (`readOnlyHint:false`,
`idempotentHint:false`): the FIRST check that finds a job finished materializes
the creation, copying the model into our storage, recording the row and running
the quality gate, and it can route failed work to another provider. Later checks
of the same job are served from the done-frame cache, which is exactly why it is
not idempotent either. It still never counts against the generation quota.
`look_at_model` is genuinely read-only and idempotent,
but it renders frames server-side, so it rides the same per-IP generation
quota as the six generators.

| Tool | Title | Input | Returns |
|---|---|---|---|
| `forge_free` | Generate a 3D model from text | `prompt`, `tier?` | GLB model |
| `text_to_avatar` | Generate a 3D avatar | `prompt?` / `image_url?` | GLB avatar |
| `mesh_forge` | Generate a 3D mesh (art-directed) | `prompt?` / `image_url?` | GLB mesh |
| `rig_mesh` | Rig a 3D model for animation | `glb_url` | rigged GLB |
| `forge_avatar` | Generate a rigged, animation-ready avatar | `prompt?` / `image_url?`, `allow_non_humanoid?` | rigged GLB avatar |
| `refine_model` | Refine a 3D model by describing a change | `glb_url`, `instruction`, `parent_prompt?`, `parent_lineage?`, `parent_index?` | refined GLB + version lineage |
| `check_job` | Check a pending 3D generation and collect it | `job_id` | GLB model, or an updated pending state |
| `look_at_model` | Look at a 3D model | `glb_url`, `views?` (up to 6 of `front`, `three-quarter`, `side`, `back`, `top`, `bottom`; default three-quarter, front, side, back), `size?` (128 to 1024 px, default 512) | rendered frames as images, plus geometry stats (triangles, materials, textures) and a plain reading of them |

### Quality tiers

`forge_free` takes an optional `tier` of `draft`, `standard`, or `high`.
**`standard` is the default**, and it is what you get when you omit the
argument. It is the balanced free lane: reliably textured, and served by
whichever free engine the router picks for the prompt (typically the
self-hosted TRELLIS worker).

`high` is a real option, not a placeholder. Ask for it by name and the
generation runs on our own self-hosted Hunyuan3D GPU worker for denser geometry.
It stays opt-in rather than becoming the default for two reasons. That worker is
scale-to-zero, so a cold container pays a spin-up on top of the generation. And
the high lane is platform-funded behind an internal access gate: if the gate
refuses (402) or the submit times out, the call degrades to standard rather than
failing the conversation, so a default of `high` would sometimes mean serving
standard while the docs promised more.

Nothing here is ever billed to you. The high tier is platform-funded, so the
caller stays anonymous and keyless at every tier. A generation can outlive one
tool call at any tier; see [Pending generations](#pending-generations-check_job)
for how it is collected rather than lost.

One naming collision worth knowing: the npm package `@three-ws/mcp-server`
([docs](./mcp.md)) also ships a tool called `forge_free`. That is a different
server with its own default (`draft`, stated in its own tool schema). The
default described here is the one for `https://three.ws/api/mcp-studio`.

### Response shape

Each successful call returns `structuredContent` carrying only what a client
needs to display the model — no internal identifiers:

```json
{
  "kind": "model",
  "glbUrl": "https://three.ws/cdn/creations/…/model.glb",
  "viewerUrl": "https://three.ws/viewer?src=…",
  "arUrl": "https://three.ws/api/ar?src=…&title=…",
  "format": "glb",
  "prompt": "a friendly round robot mascot, glossy white plastic",
  "referenceImageUrl": "https://three.ws/cdn/creations/…/model-ref.png"
}
```

`referenceImageUrl` is the concept image the generator paints first and then
sculpts into 3D (the forge's image-generation step). The inline widget uses it
as the model-viewer poster so the painted view shows while the GLB streams in,
and the result narration links it for non-widget clients.

`arUrl` is the one-tap place-in-your-room link (see [AR in ChatGPT](./chatgpt-ar.md)).
Rigged avatars additionally carry `irlUrl`, the living-agent handoff into
[IRL](./irl.md), and the inline widget's AR button becomes **Bring it to life**.
Every result also includes a `spatial` field, the open Spatial MCP artifact
(`specs/SPATIAL_MCP.md`) so any Spatial-MCP renderer can display the model.

### Pending generations (`check_job`)

A detailed model can take longer than a single tool call should block for. When
that happens the generating tool does **not** fail: it returns a success result
carrying a pollable handle, and the job keeps running server-side.

```json
{
  "status": "pending",
  "jobId": "f1.eyJwIjoiZ2NwIiw…",
  "pollUrl": "https://three.ws/api/gpt-forge?job=f1.eyJwIjoiZ2NwIiw…",
  "stage": "mesh",
  "etaRemainingSeconds": 42,
  "prompt": "a friendly round robot mascot, glossy white plastic"
}
```

`stage` names which half of the pipeline is still running, `mesh` or `rig`, so a
client that collects the job knows whether the GLB it gets back is a bare mesh
still to be rigged or the finished rig. It carries no identifier, so it costs the
data-minimization rule nothing.

`etaRemainingSeconds` is the live estimate for the lane actually running the job
(its typical duration minus time already elapsed), so the assistant knows how
long to wait rather than retrying blind. Call `check_job` with that `jobId` to
collect the result:

- **done**: returns the ordinary success envelope (`glbUrl`, `viewerUrl`,
  `arUrl`, …) and the model renders inline in the widget, exactly as if the
  original call had finished in time.
- **still rendering**: returns a fresh `pending` envelope with updated
  `etaRemainingSeconds`. Call again after the suggested wait.
- **failed**: returns a clean, actionable error.

`check_job` is read-only and idempotent, and it does not consume generation
quota, so collecting a model can never be rate-limited by the generation that
created it. The inline widget renders the pending state as a designed
"still rendering" panel with the live countdown, not an empty state.

Any HTTP client can poll `pollUrl` directly instead; it is the same public,
auth-free job handle the [3D API](/docs/3d-api) hands anonymous callers.

### Conversational refinement (`refine_model`)

Iterate on a model by describing the change in words — *"make it metallic"*,
*"bigger helmet"*, *"add wings"*. It's a REAL anchored re-generation, never a fake
diff: the prior prompt is carried forward and folded with your change
(`composeRefinement`), and an optional `reference_image_url` of the current model
anchors the regeneration as image→3D. Text-guided refinement needs only
`glb_url` + `instruction`; passing `parent_prompt` lets the change build on the
original spec instead of starting over.

Every refinement is appended to an immutable **version lineage** returned in
`structuredContent.lineage`. The client passes that array back as `parent_lineage`
on the next call to extend the same thread, or targets an earlier version with
`parent_index` to **branch**. Reverting is a pointer move over the array — no
mutation. The inline viewer renders the lineage as a version strip you can click
to cross-fade between versions.

```json
{
  "kind": "refined model",
  "glbUrl": "https://three.ws/cdn/creations/…/v1.glb",
  "viewerUrl": "https://three.ws/viewer?src=…",
  "format": "glb",
  "prompt": "a friendly round robot mascot, glossy white plastic, metallic and gold",
  "instruction": "make it metallic and gold",
  "activeIndex": 1,
  "lineage": [
    { "index": 0, "parentIndex": null, "glbUrl": "…/origin.glb", "label": "Original", "active": false },
    { "index": 1, "parentIndex": 0, "glbUrl": "…/v1.glb", "label": "make it metallic and gold", "instruction": "make it metallic and gold", "active": true }
  ]
}
```

The same `refine_model` capability is available on the paid stdio MCP server
(`3d-agent-local`, $0.25 USDC per call) via the shared lineage core, so iteration
behaves identically on both tracks.

## Embodiment — a living agent body

Three additional free tools turn a generated avatar into a **persistent, living
agent body** that renders inline in the chat: it lip-syncs each reply, shows the
matching expression and gesture, idles between turns, and returns as the same body
across sessions. A persona is a name and a 3D body — nothing about tokens, wallets,
or payments.

| Tool | Title | Input | Returns |
|---|---|---|---|
| `create_agent_persona` | Save a rigged model as a living, persistent agent body | `glb_url`, `name`, `voice?`, `source_prompt?` | `persona_id` + inline living body (idle) |
| `get_agent_persona` | Reload a persona by id (continuity across sessions) | `persona_id` | the same body + turn count |
| `persona_say` | Speak a reply through a persona: lip-sync + emotion + gesture | `persona_id`, `text`, `emotion?` | the body performing the reply |

Annotations: `create_agent_persona` and `persona_say` are writes
(`readOnlyHint:false`); `get_agent_persona` is a pure read (`readOnlyHint:true`,
`idempotentHint:true`). `create_agent_persona` carries `openWorldHint:true`
because it fetches the GLB you hand it from wherever it lives before taking a
durable copy; `get_agent_persona` and `persona_say` touch only three.ws's own
store, so both are `openWorldHint:false`.

**How it renders.** In ChatGPT (Apps SDK), each persona tool points its tool-level
`_meta["openai/outputTemplate"]` at the registered
`ui://widget/three-studio-persona.html` widget, which reads the tool's
`structuredContent` and mounts the hosted embodiment page (a result-level template
on an inline artifact is ignored by the Apps SDK, so the tool-level link is what
makes the body appear). In every other MCP host the tool result carries an inline
`text/html` resource that frames the same hosted page,
`https://three.ws/embodiment/embed`, with the
persona id and the turn's speak/emotion payload as query params. That page mounts
`EmbodimentStage` (Three.js), which rides the platform's universal
canonicalize/retarget pipeline so the baked idle + gesture clip library drives any
humanoid rig. Emotion is detected from the reply text (or set explicitly via
`emotion`) and blended onto the face **and** an upper-body gesture; lip-sync is
best-first — an Audio2Face viseme track synced to TTS audio when present, else a
deterministic text-timed mouth envelope.

**Graceful states, never a frozen pose.** A rig with no facial morphs still
animates its mouth from the jaw (or head) bone. A model that can't be
skeleton-driven — no skin, or a non-humanoid prop — is detected up front
(`decideRigMode` / `AnimationManager.supportsCanonicalClips()`) and falls back to a
gentle alive-idle with a designed note, never a bind-pose T-pose.

**Continuity.** The persona is persisted (durable GLB copy + a small identity
record) and addressed by an unguessable `persona_id` — that id is the whole
capability, so a fresh session reloads the exact same body with no sign-in. When
the embed is opened with only an id (no inline `glb`), it resolves the durable body
via `GET /api/mcp3d/persona?id=persona_…`, which returns the public projection
(name, GLB, turn count) — never storage keys or owner ids.

```json
{
  "persona_id": "persona_9f3aK2…",
  "name": "Nova",
  "glb_url": "https://three.ws/…/nova.glb",
  "emotion": "joy",
  "intensity": 0.7,
  "gesture": "av-celebrating",
  "turn_count": 3,
  "status": "spoken"
}
```

The same three tools ship on the paid stdio MCP server (`3d-agent-local`) so
embodiment behaves identically on both tracks; both drive the one hosted embed.

## Funding & limits

Generation is **operator-funded**: the platform's server-side keys cover provider
cost, so the ChatGPT user pays nothing, at any tier. Routing is **free-first**: no
backend is pinned, and the health-aware router in `api/gpt-forge.js` prefers the
free lanes (self-hosted TRELLIS, NVIDIA NIM text→3D, Hugging Face Spaces
image→3D), so in the normal case the platform's marginal cost per generation is
zero. The platform-keyed Replicate lane stays in the chain as a failover rung
rather than being excluded, so a free-lane outage degrades to a slower or
costlier engine instead of failing the user's request. Either way the cost lands
on the platform and never on the caller: no key, no account, no payment surface.

The endpoint still enforces real per-IP abuse protection (`api/_lib/rate-limit.js`):

- **Burst:** 4 generations / minute / IP
- **Hourly:** 30 generations / hour / IP
- **Persona writes:** 20 / minute / IP (`create_agent_persona`, `persona_say`;
  `get_agent_persona` is a read and rides the transport cap)
- **Transport:** 300 requests / minute / IP (discovery, never throttled by the
  generation quota)
- **Platform-wide breaker:** a global cap across every free-studio caller,
  backstopping the shared GPU budget when many distinct IPs, each individually
  under the hourly cap, would collectively drain it

The generation quota is charged only when a request actually calls a generation
tool, so `initialize`, `tools/list`, `resources/list`, and `check_job` are never
throttled by it.

Because the lanes are zero-cost, the **per-IP** caps **fail open** if the
rate-limiter backend has an outage: a Redis blip must never dead-end a free
feature (the same posture as the paid server's own free lane). The platform-wide
breaker is the deliberate exception and **fails closed** in production, since a
limiter outage is exactly when an unbounded global spend would do real damage.
Any accidental paid-lane spend is still fail-closed one layer further down in
`/api/gpt-forge` (the ChatGPT-dedicated clone of `/api/forge`; see the note under
Environment).

## Safety

Generation prompts are screened for age-13+ appropriateness before any provider
work (`api/_mcp-studio/safety.js`): sexual/adult, child-sexual, graphically
violent, hateful/extremist, and real-weapon/drug prompts are refused with a
clear message. Stylized fantasy props (a sword, a wand) are allowed.

## Environment

All optional — sensible production defaults:

| Var | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `STUDIO_API_BASE` | request origin → `PUBLIC_APP_ORIGIN` → `https://three.ws` | Origin to call `/api/gpt-forge` on |
| `STUDIO_FORGE_TIMEOUT_MS` | `180000` | Generation poll budget |
| `STUDIO_RIG_TIMEOUT_MS` | `180000` | Rig poll budget |
| `STUDIO_REFINE_TIMEOUT_MS` | `180000` | `refine_model` poll budget |
| `STUDIO_POLL_MS` | `3000` | Starting poll interval |
| `STUDIO_POLL_MAX_MS` | `10000` | Ceiling the poll interval backs off to |

Generation runs on `/api/gpt-forge` (`api/gpt-forge.js`), the ChatGPT-dedicated
exact clone of `/api/forge`: same lanes, tiers, job tokens, and `forge_creations`
rows, cloned so the ChatGPT pipeline can be tuned without touching the forge or
any surface that rides it. The agent-facing REST endpoints (`/api/3d/generate`,
`/api/v1/ai/text-to-3d`) stay on `/api/forge`.

The inline widget loads Google's `<model-viewer>` from one pinned URL in
[`api/_lib/model-viewer-cdn.js`](../api/_lib/model-viewer-cdn.js), which is also
the origin the widget's `openai/widgetCSP` allowlists, so the script tag and its
CSP entry cannot drift apart. That module pins the one build every three.ws
surface loads, so a host page that already has a three.ws embed reuses the same
module instead of registering a second, conflicting custom element. The
standalone [`/viewer`](../public/viewer.html) page and the Vite-bundled
first-party pages ship the same version and differ only in how they fetch it:
a top-level document can carry an SRI hash, a template-interpolated embed and a
runtime CDN failover chain cannot. The header comment in
`api/_lib/model-viewer-cdn.js` names all three delivery rungs, and
`npm run check:model-viewer` fails the build if one of them drifts off the
shared version. The `/api/ar` launcher no longer inlines a
`<model-viewer>` of its own: Android gets a Scene Viewer intent, and every other
device (and every live avatar) is sent on to `/ar/view`, a Vite-bundled page
that generates a real USDZ from the GLB on the device so iPhone gets genuine
Quick Look rather than a camera overlay (`api/_lib/ar-launch.js`).
