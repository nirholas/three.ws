# X announcement coverage: every platform surface vs @trythreews

Source: `trythreews_tweets_2026-08-09.json` (174 posts scraped 2026-08-09, first post 2026-04-17) cross-referenced against `data/pages.json`, `packages/*`, the top-level SDKs, and `workers/` + `services/`.

**This file is the audit, not the plan.** It establishes which surfaces have been posted about, as of the
scrape date above. The prioritized work queue derived from it, with clusters, waves, verified blockers and
checkboxes, is [announcement-checklist.md](./announcement-checklist.md).

Status legend: **Yes** = the surface was specifically announced or demoed in a post. **Passing** = covered only by a related, aggregate, or partner post (never given its own announcement). **No** = never referenced on X in any form.

## Summary

| Inventory | Total | Announced | Passing mention | Never announced |

On top of that sit 348 learn/docs pages and 39 blog posts (content, not counted as features). Counting those, 673+ committed surfaces have never appeared on X.

Of the 174 posts: roughly 40 are product/feature announcements, the rest are partnerships, marketplace and registry listings, media coverage, community events, and token posts.

## Strongest unannounced candidates

286 real surfaces have never been posted. These are the ones with the most announcement potential, judged by novelty, demo-ability, and fit with what already performed well on the timeline:

| Surface(s) | Why it will land |
|---|---|
| `@three-ws/three-token-mcp` | The first MCP server whose actions burn a token. A $THREE-native world-first, one post writes itself. |
| `/forge-max` | The highest-quality text and image to 3D lane. Forge posts are consistently the best performers. |
| `/motion-swap` + `/mocap-studio` + `@three-ws/mocap` | Replace yourself in any video with your avatar; webcam motion capture as an API. Extremely screenshotable. |
| `/capture` + `/splat` | Video to 3D point cloud, photoreal Gaussian avatars. Visually stunning demo material. |
| `/genome` + `/genesis` | Breed two agents into a child agent; instant agent genesis. Nothing else on the timeline is like it. |
| `/wardrobe` + `/fits` + `workers/garment-forge` | A full cosmetics economy for avatars: forge garments, dress agents, trade fits. |
| `/oracle` + `/activity` | The AI conviction engine with a live activity feed. Backbone of the trading story. |
| `/guardian` | Recover and inherit agent wallets. A trust feature nobody in the agent space has shipped. |
| `/arena` + `/clash` + `/play/war` | Live PvP trading tournaments, faction wars, and the new Coin Wars battlefield. Community-native content. |
| `/vaults` + `/labor-market` + `/signals` | Back an agent with capital, hire agents on a labor market, sell alpha feeds ranked by proven edge. The agent economy endgame posts. |
| `/mirror` + `/swarms` + `/ghost-copy` | Copy trading, trading swarms, and "what if you had copied them" replays. |
| `/launch-studio` | 50 ways to mint a coin. A listicle-shaped feature. |
| `readme-3d` | Interactive 3D models inside any GitHub README. Developer-viral by construction. |
| `@three-ws/agent-memory` + `@three-ws/agent-runtime` + `@three-ws/agent-guards` | The open agent stack: memory, decision loop, and spend-policy safety rails. A strong developer thread. |
| `/concierge` + `/assistant` | The AI concierge and assistant widgets: the embeddable business story beyond avatars. |
| `/agenc/embodied` + `/agenc/room` + `@three-ws/agenc` | On-chain agent-to-agent task coordination on Solana, with embodied task rooms. |
| `/choreograph` + `/gestures` | Choreograph avatar movement and gesture packs on top of the 3,000+ animation library already announced. |
| `/portfolio` + `/airdrops` + `/wallet` | The wallet suite: portfolio, airdrop checker, master wallet. Practical daily-use posts. |
| `/theater` + `/pulse` + `/flow` | Live trading theater and money-flow visualizations: the agent economy as a spectator sport. |
| `@three-ws/skill-license` | Purchased agent skills as on-chain 1/1 licenses. Ties skills, ownership, and revenue together. |

Method note: status was assigned by reading all 174 posts and matching each one to the surfaces it names, shows, or links. Aggregate posts (the packages post, the crypto intelligence post, partner threads) were counted as passing mentions for the surfaces they cover, never as announcements.
