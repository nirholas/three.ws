# Discover and Pay for an x402 Service

By the end of this tutorial you'll be able to find a paid API in the [Bazaar](/bazaar), pay for one call in USDC, and get back real work — no API key, no account, no subscription. You'll do it four ways: from the Bazaar UI with a wallet, from the hosted [/pay](/pay) checkout, programmatically with `window.X402.pay`, and by letting an autonomous agent shop the catalog for you on [/shopper](/shopper).

This is the **consume** side of x402. If you want to *build* an endpoint that takes these payments, see [paid-x402-endpoint](/tutorials/paid-x402-endpoint) — this tutorial is everything on the other side of that handshake.

**Prerequisites:**

- A browser wallet: **Phantom** (or Solflare) for Solana, or **MetaMask** / **Coinbase Wallet** for Base (EVM). The checkout detects whichever is installed. **Or no browser wallet at all:** if you're signed in to three.ws and one of your agents holds USDC in its own wallet, the checkout offers that agent as a payment method and settles server-side, with no extension and no popup (see "Paying" below).
- A small USDC balance on the network you'll pay from. Most calls are $0.001–$0.01, so ~$1 USDC funds thousands of them. On Solana you also need a little SOL for the account; on Base the signature is gasless from your side.
- Light JavaScript familiarity for the programmatic path (Steps 5–6). The UI paths (Steps 2–4) need none.

## What you're building

Paying for an x402 service is two HTTP round trips and one wallet signature:

```
You → GET  /api/some-paid-thing            (no payment)
    ← 402 Payment Required  { accepts: [ { network, asset, amount, payTo } ] }
You → sign a USDC payment for one of the `accepts`
You → GET  /api/some-paid-thing            (X-PAYMENT: <signed payload>)
    ← 200  { ...the actual work... }        (X-PAYMENT-RESPONSE: <on-chain receipt>)
```

The price, the recipient, and the network all come from the seller's 402 challenge — you never type them. Your wallet signs exactly that amount to exactly that address, the platform settles it on-chain, and the original request is retried automatically. You either get what you paid for or you pay nothing.

---

## How discovery and payment fit together (two minutes of theory)

There are two distinct problems: **finding** an endpoint and **paying** it.

**Finding.** The [Bazaar](/bazaar) is a discovery surface. Server-side, `/api/bazaar/list` (`api/bazaar/list.js`) and `/api/bazaar/search` (`api/bazaar/search.js`) call each configured facilitator's `/discovery/resources` route, merge the catalogs, dedupe (HTTP by resource URL, MCP by `resource + toolName`), normalize the shape, and apply your filters. The default facilitators are PayAI (`facilitator.payai.network`, Base + Solana) and Coinbase CDP (`api.cdp.coinbase.com/platform/v2/x402`, Base + EVM L2s), wired in `api/_lib/x402/bazaar-client.js`. An endpoint shows up here once it has answered a discovery probe with a valid 402 — there is no submission form. (How three.ws gets *its own* endpoints into those catalogs is the build-side concern covered in [paid-x402-endpoint](/tutorials/paid-x402-endpoint).)

**Paying.** Every payment runs through the same drop-in module, `public/x402.js`, exposed as `window.X402.pay(...)`. It does the 402 → sign → retry dance for you:

- For **Solana**, the wallet can only sign serialized transactions, so the module posts the challenge's `accept` to `/api/x402-checkout?action=prepare` (`api/x402-checkout.js`), gets back a partially-signed SPL `transferChecked`, has Phantom add the buyer's signature, then `?action=encode`s it into the `X-PAYMENT` header.
- For **Base / EVM**, the wallet signs an EIP-3009 `transferWithAuthorization` typed-data message locally — no server prep needed.
- For an **agent wallet** (signed-in three.ws users only), no browser wallet is involved at all. The modal lists your agents with their live USDC balances (from `/api/x402-pay?agents=1`), and picking one sends the payment through `POST /api/x402-pay`: the server decrypts the agent's custodial key (audit-logged), enforces the agent's per-call/daily spend policy *before* signing, builds and settles the SPL transfer, and streams progress back. Underfunded agents render disabled with their exact balance; the option pays Solana USDC only, and never appears on third-party merchant embeds (the session cookie doesn't travel cross-origin). Called with a bearer API key or OAuth token instead of a session, `POST /api/x402-pay` requires the `wallet:write` scope and answers `403 insufficient_scope` without it; a `wallet:read` credential can still list balances.

Either way the signed payload is base64-encoded into `X-PAYMENT`, the gated request is retried once, and the unlocked result plus the decoded `X-PAYMENT-RESPONSE` receipt come back.

---

## Step 1: Browse the Bazaar

Open [/bazaar](/bazaar). You'll see a searchable, filterable grid of every paid service the facilitators currently advertise.

The sidebar filters map directly to the catalog query:

- **Type** — `http` (paid REST endpoints) or `mcp` (paid MCP tools). HTTP is the default.
- **Network** — Base, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, Solana, or Base Sepolia.
- **Max price** — a USDC ceiling; entered in dollars, sent to the API as 6-decimal atomic units.
- **Extension** — narrow to endpoints advertising a specific x402 extension (e.g. `sign-in-with-x`).
- **Sort** — including by price, ascending.

Type a query (e.g. `weather`, `reputation`, `model`) and the page switches from `/api/bazaar/list` to `/api/bazaar/search`, ranking results against your terms. The footer shows which facilitators answered and which failed, so a single down source never blanks the page.

The live catalog runs to well over a thousand listings and one request returns at most a page of them (200 for a browse, 100 for a search). The result count reads `200 of 1465` so you can tell a page from the whole catalog, and **Load more** fetches the next page with `offset` and appends it. The same `offset` parameter is on both endpoints if you are calling them yourself:

<!-- runnable: 200 walks the catalog a page at a time -->
```bash
curl -s "https://three.ws/api/bazaar/list?type=http&limit=50&offset=50"
```

Each card shows the service name, description, price (minimum USDC across its `accepts`), supported networks, the provider host (links to its [/providers](/providers) profile), and — when several listings do the same job — a **peer hint** comparing prices across them. That last one matters: the same capability is often sold by multiple providers at different prices.

---

## Step 2: Pay for a service from the Bazaar

Find an HTTP service you want and click **Try it** on its card.

1. The drop-in payment modal opens, having already re-fetched the live 402 challenge to confirm the current price (prices can change; the card is a cached hint, the modal is the source of truth).
2. The modal shows the **price**, the **network**, and **who you're paying** — the on-chain `payTo` address, linked to a block explorer so you can verify the recipient before committing.
3. If the resource is priced in more than one token on the same network, a **token chooser** appears above the wallet list with each option's real price, so you compare (say) 0.001 USDC against 10 THREE before signing. three.ws quotes USDC and `$THREE` on its own paid endpoints; the server's preferred token is first and selected by default. Agent wallets settle Solana USDC only, so on a non-USDC token they say so rather than disappearing.
4. Pick your wallet. The modal only offers wallets that match a network in the challenge's `accepts` and are actually detected in your browser; undetected ones render disabled with an "install" hint. Signed-in users with funded agents also see a **"Your agents"** group at the top; picking one skips the wallet popup entirely and pays from the agent's own USDC under its spend limits.
5. On your first payment the modal asks you to sign the three.ws real-funds agreements (Terms of Service, Risk Disclosure, Agent Wallet Agreement) at [/legal/agreements](/legal/agreements). It is once per account, and declining stops the payment. The server enforces the same signature on the agent-wallet path, which answers `403 risk_ack_required` without it.
6. Approve the payment in your wallet. Before prompting you, the modal does a fail-open balance pre-check: if it can positively read that your wallet is short, it shows an insufficient-funds state with the exact shortfall and an explorer link, instead of letting you sign a doomed transaction.
7. The platform settles on-chain and retries the call. The card's receipt area fills in with the result and a link to the on-chain transaction.

What you signed is exactly what the challenge declared — the modal never invents an amount or a recipient. If the seller configured optional charity / round-up giving on a Solana checkout, you'll see a pre-checked, opt-out box that rides the *same* transaction, so you still pay once.

> **Some providers cannot be paid from a browser at all.** The modal confirms the live price by calling the endpoint from the page, and roughly two thirds of the catalog's hosts answer their 402 without any CORS headers, which a browser refuses to let a page read. Those listings say so by name ("<host> does not allow browser requests"), and offer no retry, because retrying cannot change it. Call those endpoints from a server, an agent, or the x402 CLI instead; the price on the card is still the facilitator's live figure.

> **MCP tools** can't be paid through this modal — they need a JSON-RPC `tools/call` envelope the modal doesn't speak. Clicking a `mcp`-type card opens the details panel instead, with the schema you'd wire into an MCP client. To call MCP tools by paying per-call, see [mcp-server-for-your-agent](/tutorials/mcp-server-for-your-agent).

---

## Step 3: Read the 402 challenge yourself

To understand what the modal is doing, hit a paid endpoint by hand. Any x402 endpoint answers an unpaid request with a 402:

<!-- runnable: 402 the unpaid 402 challenge is the whole lesson here -->
```bash
curl -i https://three.ws/api/x402/model-check
```

You get back a `402 Payment Required` whose JSON body (and a base64 mirror in the `payment-required` response header) contains an `accepts` array. One entry looks like:

```jsonc
{
  "scheme": "exact",
  "network": "solana:5eykt4UsFv8P8NJdTREpY1vzqKqZKvdp",  // Solana mainnet; "eip155:8453" for Base
  "amount": "1000",                                     // 6-decimal atomic USDC → $0.001
  "asset": "EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v", // USDC mint
  "payTo": "<recipient address>",
  "maxTimeoutSeconds": 60,
  "extra": { "name": "USDC", "decimals": 6, "feePayer": "<sponsor>" }
}
```

Read it like a receipt-in-advance:

- **`amount`** is in atomic units of **`asset`**. With `decimals: 6`, `"1000"` is $0.001. (Spec-strict sellers may name this field `maxAmountRequired`; the client coerces both to `amount`.)
- **`network`** tells you which wallet you need. `solana` / `solana:*` → Phantom/Solflare; `eip155:8453` → Base; other `eip155:*` are the EVM L2s in `EVM_NETWORKS` (`public/x402-pay-core.js`).
- **`payTo`** is exactly where your USDC goes. Nothing else moves.
- **`extra.feePayer`** is the sponsor that co-signs the Solana transaction so your SOL is untouched. It is optional: an accept with no `feePayer` is the **self-pay** contract, where you cover the network fee yourself. The modal says so on the approve step ("you cover the network fee on this one") rather than letting the wallet popup be the first you hear of it.
- **`maxTimeoutSeconds`** bounds how long your signed authorization is valid — your one safety net against a stale payment lingering.

A single endpoint can list several `accepts` (e.g. Base *and* Solana). You, or your wallet, pick whichever network you hold funds on. A Base entry may also appear twice: the plain EIP-3009 one, and a sibling marked `extra.assetTransferMethod: "permit2"` for SDK clients that use the gas-sponsored Permit2 path. The browser modal always signs the EIP-3009 entry and skips the Permit2 sibling.

---

## Step 4: Pay through the /pay surface

[/pay](/pay) is the platform's own pay-per-call surface — a live demo that pays $0.001 USDC on Solana to call MCP tools and render 3D assets, with a settlement timeline you can watch step by step. Use it to see a real settlement end to end before wiring your own.

Two related routes sit under it:

- **[/pay/calls](/pay/calls)** — the public ledger of paid x402 calls to the platform. Each settled call gets a permalink (`/pay/calls/<tx-signature>`) showing the tool invoked and the on-chain transaction. This is your audit trail: every payment you make here is verifiable on-chain by anyone.
- **`/pay/c/<slug>`** — a *hosted checkout link*. A provider creates a SKU in their dashboard (see `api/x402-skus.js`) and shares the URL; the page hydrates from `/api/x402-skus?slug=<slug>` and opens the same drop-in modal pre-wired to that endpoint. If someone hands you a `/pay/c/...` link, paying it is identical to Step 2 — open it, pick a wallet, approve.

The point of the `/pay` surface: the *exact same* payment core (`public/x402.js` and its sibling `public/x402-pay-core.js`) drives the Bazaar's "Try it", the hosted checkout, the full-page paywall, and the programmatic call below. Learn it once.

---

## Step 5: Pay programmatically with window.X402.pay

When you want to trigger a paid call from your own page or script, skip the UI and call the module directly. Load it once:

```html
<script type="module" src="https://three.ws/x402.js"></script>
```

Then pay for any endpoint:

```js
const out = await window.X402.pay({
  endpoint: 'https://three.ws/api/x402/model-check?url=' +
            encodeURIComponent('https://three.ws/avatars/cesium-man.glb'),
  method: 'GET',
  merchant: 'three.ws',
  action: 'Model Check',
});

if (out.ok) {
  console.log('result:', out.result);        // the work product
  console.log('paid on:', out.payment.network);
  console.log('tx:', out.payment.transaction); // on-chain settlement
}
```

`pay()` opens the modal, runs discovery → connect → sign → verify → retry, and resolves with `{ ok, result, payment, response }`. On a user cancel it rejects with an error whose `code === 'cancelled'` — handle that distinctly from a real failure.

Useful options:

- **`body`** — a JSON object for `POST` endpoints (method defaults to `POST` when a body is present).
- **`headers`** — extra request headers forwarded on the paid retry.
- **`networks`** — an allowlist to force a single rail, e.g. `['solana']` for a Solana-only checkout, or `['evm']` / `['eip155:8453']`. The modal drops every `accept` outside the allowlist before rendering the wallet picker. If the filter would empty the list, it keeps the original accepts so a misconfigured allowlist never breaks a live checkout.

For a declarative trigger, any element with `data-x402-endpoint` is auto-bound on load and fires an `x402:result` (or `x402:error`) CustomEvent when done:

```html
<button
  data-x402-endpoint="https://three.ws/api/x402/model-check"
  data-x402-method="GET"
  data-x402-merchant="three.ws"
  data-x402-action="Model Check"
>Pay &amp; Run</button>
```

To wire paid calls into an **agent's** conversation (so it buys mid-chat when the user asks), put the same pattern in a skill handler via `ctx.x402.fetch` — covered in [custom-skill](/tutorials/custom-skill) and the caller half of [paid-x402-endpoint](/tutorials/paid-x402-endpoint).

---

## Step 6: Let an agent shop the Bazaar for you

When you don't know *which* endpoint you need, the [Endpoint Shopper](/shopper) does the discovery, payment, and synthesis for you. Describe a task, set a USDC budget, and the agent searches the Bazaar for relevant endpoints, pays for each call it decides to make (capped at your budget), and returns a synthesized answer with a per-step cost breakdown.

```
Task:   "What is the current price of ETH?"
Budget: $0.50
        ↓  [discover → plan → call (pays per endpoint) → synthesize]
Answer: "ETH is trading around $3,180." — total spent: $0.012 USDC across 2 paid steps
```

The page posts to `/api/agents/endpoint-shopper-run` with `{ task, maxCostUsd }`. The agent itself charges a small base fee and spends up to your budget downstream — set the budget at or above $0.01 so it can fund at least one paid call (the UI gates the button below that). The timeline shows each step's action (discover / plan / call / synthesize), the endpoint it hit, and what that step cost; the final row sums the spend, showing **"Free (no paid calls executed)"** when the task needed none.

If running the Shopper itself returns a 402, the page hands you off to the wallet paywall to unlock it — the same payment core as every other path here.

This is the autonomous consumer pattern: you express intent and a budget; the agent turns the Bazaar into a tool it pays for on demand. To coordinate multiple agents around a buying flow, see [multi-agent-coordination](/tutorials/multi-agent-coordination).

---

## Step 7: Verify what you paid for

Every successful payment returns an on-chain receipt — make a habit of checking it:

- **In the UI** — the Bazaar receipt and the modal both link the settlement transaction to a block explorer (Solscan for Solana, Basescan/Arbiscan/etc. for EVM).
- **Programmatically** — `out.payment.transaction` is the on-chain tx; `out.payment.network` and `out.payment.payer` tell you which rail settled and from which wallet.
- **On the public ledger** — platform calls land on [/pay/calls](/pay/calls) with a permalink anyone can audit.

If the result looks wrong but you were charged, note: x402 has **single-shot, no-refund** semantics — you pay for the *attempt*, not a guaranteed *result*. A failed call after settlement is not auto-refunded; retrying means a fresh payment. That's why the verify-then-work-then-settle ordering on the seller side (see [paid-x402-endpoint](/tutorials/paid-x402-endpoint)) matters to you as a buyer: a correctly built endpoint never settles when its work failed, so you don't pay for nothing.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **"Payment module failed to load (x402.js)"** on a Bazaar card — the drop-in script 404'd or didn't evaluate, so `window.X402` is undefined. Reload the page; check the network tab for the `/x402.js` request.
- **Wallet button is disabled** — that wallet isn't detected, or no `accept` matches its network. Install the extension (Phantom for Solana, MetaMask/Coinbase for Base) and reload, or pick the other rail.
- **"Not enough USDC — you need X but your wallet holds Y"** — the balance pre-check caught a shortfall before you signed. Top up the wallet on the shown network (the error links your address on the explorer) and retry. The check is fail-open: if your balance can't be read, payment still proceeds.
- **"Payments are temporarily paused while we top up the wallet that settles them"**: a `503 settlement_unavailable`, the sponsor wallet that pays network fees is under its SOL reserve. (The daily fee budget only paces the platform's own autonomous traffic; a paying customer's settle is admitted past it.) Nothing was charged and the error is marked retryable; try again shortly.
- **"... rewrote the payment transaction before signing ..."**: your Solana wallet changed the prepared transaction (a different transfer, a swapped fee payer, or an unknown program), so it can no longer settle and nothing was sent. Phantom's default transaction protection is not the cause: its Lighthouse guard instructions are accepted. Turn off transaction modification in the wallet, or pay with a different Solana wallet.
- **"Your wallet could not display this payment request"**: the wallet refused to open its approval window. Nothing was signed or charged; unlock or update the wallet and retry, or pay with the other token.
- **"Endpoint did not return 402 (got 200/404…)"** — you pointed `pay()` at a free or non-x402 URL. Confirm the endpoint actually challenges with `curl -i <url>` (Step 3).
- **402 but "no `accepts` array could be found"** — a proxy stripped the body *and* the `payment-required` header, or the seller's challenge is malformed. Try the endpoint's own canonical URL; if it's third-party, the seller's 402 is non-compliant.
- **Signature rejected at settle on Base** — almost always a wrong EIP-712 domain. Base USDC's domain name is `"USD Coin"` at version `"2"`; a seller advertising anything else produces a payload the facilitator rejects. Nothing you can fix as a buyer — report it to the provider.
- **Solana checkout fails at "Authorize"**: usually a stale blockhash on a flaky RPC; the prepare endpoint fails open to a recent cached blockhash, so simply retry. A too-stale blockhash never confirms and never double-charges. When the chain is unreadable and nothing is cached, `/api/x402-checkout?action=prepare` answers a typed `503 rpc_unavailable` with a `Retry-After: 15` header instead of an opaque 500; the agent-wallet path (`POST /api/x402-pay`) returns the same code with a note that no funds were transferred.
- **"The Solana wallet component could not be loaded"**: the Solana path fetches `@solana/web3.js` on demand from esm.sh, then jsdelivr and unpkg for the same pinned version, each under a deadline. All three failing means the host page's Content-Security-Policy is blocking third-party modules; the message names the hosts it tried and steers you to a Base wallet, which needs no third-party code.
- **Clicking an MCP card doesn't open a payment modal** — by design; MCP tools open the details panel. Wire them through an MCP client ([mcp-server-for-your-agent](/tutorials/mcp-server-for-your-agent)).
- **Endpoint Shopper button stays disabled** — the budget is below $0.01 or the task is empty; the hint under the button names the exact unmet precondition.

---

## Recap

You learned four ways to consume an x402 paid service:

- **The Bazaar** ([/bazaar](/bazaar)) — search and filter the merged facilitator catalog, then **Try it** to pay with a wallet through the drop-in modal.
- **The /pay surface** ([/pay](/pay), [/pay/calls](/pay/calls), `/pay/c/<slug>`) — the platform's live pay-per-call demo, public on-chain ledger, and hosted checkout links — all driven by the same payment core.
- **`window.X402.pay`** — pay for any endpoint from your own code; resolves with the result plus an on-chain receipt, with a `networks` allowlist to pin the rail.
- **The Endpoint Shopper** ([/shopper](/shopper)) — describe a task and a budget; an agent discovers, pays for, and synthesizes results from Bazaar endpoints autonomously.

The throughline: discovery and payment are decoupled, the 402 challenge is the single source of truth for price, token, and recipient, every payment settles on-chain in the asset you picked (USDC, or `$THREE` where a three.ws endpoint quotes it), and one module (`public/x402.js`) drives every surface.

**Use it from your own project (npm)**

Outside the browser — in a Node service, an agent runtime, or a CLI — install the
standalone buyer package instead of the hosted module:

```bash
npm i @three-ws/x402-fetch
```

```js
import { withX402, privateKeyToWallet } from '@three-ws/x402-fetch';

// Wrap fetch once with a wallet; paid endpoints settle automatically in USDC.
const pay = withX402(privateKeyToWallet(process.env.WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY), { maxPaymentUsd: 0.05 });
const res = await pay('https://api.example.com/paid', { method: 'POST', body });
```

Full API, wallet/signer options, and examples are in the
[`@three-ws/x402-fetch` README](https://github.com/nirholas/x402-fetch); the whole
package family is listed under [x402 → Open-source packages](/x402#open-source-packages).
