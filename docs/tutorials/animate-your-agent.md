# Give your agent body language

By the end of this tutorial your agent will move on its own: nod when a model finishes loading, look down while it reads on-chain data, celebrate a settled payment, and dance when you ask it to. You will know which gesture fires when, how to swap any of them for a different clip, and how to drive one from your own code.

**Prerequisites:** a browser. The last two sections use an agent you own, which the first section shows you how to create, and a text editor for a few lines of JavaScript.

**Time:** about 12 minutes.

## What you're building

```
A skill runs  ──►  it declares a hint  ──►  the hint resolves to a slot
                                                     │
                          your override map ──────────┤
                                                     ▼
                                        the slot resolves to a clip
                                                     │
                                                     ▼
                                        the avatar plays it
```

Three names, one chain. Worth learning in this order, because each one only exists to keep the next one loose:

| | What it is | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **A clip** | A baked motion file. 112 of them ship with the platform | `av-offabean-dance`, `lookdown`, `wave` |
| **A slot** | A fixed name for an intention. Resolves to a clip, and you can re-point it | `dance`, `inspect`, `wave` |
| **A hint** | What a skill declares when it starts. Resolves to a slot | `gesture`, `inspect`, `gesture-magic` |

An agent never names a clip. It names a slot, or a skill names a hint, and the platform resolves the rest. That is what lets you hand one agent a different body language without touching a line of skill code.

## 1. See the whole vocabulary

Open **[three.ws/gestures](https://three.ws/gestures)**.

Every slot an agent can play is on that page, on a card with the clip it resolves to. Click one and it plays on a live avatar. Three things are worth noticing before you build anything:

- **`inspect` plays `lookdown`.** Nineteen skills declare that hint, every read-only lookup in the catalog. It is the gesture your agent will spend the most time in.
- **`bow` plays `sitclap`.** The one approximation in the vocabulary, marked `approx` on its card: no bow clip is baked yet, so it borrows a seated clap. Everything else plays a clip that means what the slot means.
- **The hint table underneath is generated from the shipped skills**, so the skill names next to each hint are the real ones, not an illustration.

Deep-link any slot to show someone: [three.ws/gestures?slot=celebrate](https://three.ws/gestures?slot=celebrate).

---

## 2. Create an agent and watch it move on its own

Go to **[three.ws/create](https://three.ws/create)**, give the agent a name and a body, and save. You now have a hosted agent at `three.ws/a/<your-agent>`.

Open it and watch the avatar while the page settles:

| What you do | What fires | What you see |
|---|---|---|
| Load the page | `_onLoadStart` | `think` slot: the avatar thinks while the model streams in |
| The model finishes | `_onLoadEnd` | `nod` slot: a nod of acknowledgement |
| Ask it something that runs a read-only skill | hint `inspect` | `lookdown`: it reads |
| Ask it to buy or launch something | hint `gesture` | `point`: a decisive hand gesture |
| A skill succeeds | celebration stimulus | the face brightens; a clean validation plays `celebrate` |
| A skill fails | concern stimulus | `concern`: the `defeated` clip, with a downward gaze |

None of that is scripted per agent. It comes from the slot vocabulary, so every agent on the platform has it from the moment it exists.

---

## 3. Swap one gesture for another

Your agent's personality lives partly in which clips it uses. A trading agent that celebrates with `av-headbang` reads differently from one that plays `celebrate`.

On [three.ws/gestures](https://three.ws/gestures), click the slot you want to change, pick a clip from the **Override this slot** dropdown, and copy the JSON. You will get exactly this shape:

```json
{
  "edits": {
    "animations": {
      "dance": "av-offabean-dance"
    }
  }
}
```

To apply it, open your agent's editor, go to **Body → Gesture slots**, and pick a clip for the slot. There is one row per slot, `Platform default` inherits the platform clip, and **Save gestures** writes the map. Reload the agent page and the gesture is yours.

If you would rather do it from code, the same thing over the API:

```bash
curl -X PUT https://three.ws/api/agents/$AGENT_ID/animations \
  -H "authorization: Bearer $THREE_WS_TOKEN" \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "animationSlots": {
      "dance": "av-offabean-dance",
      "celebrate": "av-cheering",
      "think": "av-smoking",
      "inspect": "av-spy"
    }
  }'
```

Anything not listed keeps the platform default, so a map is only as long as the changes you want. `"animationSlots": {}` clears every override. The map is stored on the agent at `meta.edits.animations` and published on its public manifest as `animationSlots`, so an `<agent-3d>` embed of that agent plays its body language too.

Every field on that endpoint is optional and follows one rule: **present means replace this, absent means leave it alone.** Send `animationSlots` on its own and the agent's clip list, animation graph and choreographies are untouched. Do not pad the body with `"animations": []` to satisfy the schema, because an empty array is a real value and wipes the clip list. The body only has to carry at least one of `animations`, `animationGraph`, `animationSlots` or `choreographies`, or you get a `400`.

Two things the endpoint will reject rather than silently accept: a slot name outside the vocabulary (a typo would create a gesture nothing ever plays) and a clip name that is not a plain alphanumeric name.

Any of the 112 clip names in [`/animations/manifest.json`](https://three.ws/animations/manifest.json) is valid. Browse them with previews at [three.ws/animations](https://three.ws/animations).

## 4. Drive a gesture from your own code

An embedded avatar takes clips directly. Add the web component to any page, and set the clip it starts on with the `clip` attribute:

```html
<script type="module" src="https://three.ws/agent-3d/latest/agent-3d.js"></script>

<agent-3d
	body="https://three.ws/avatars/cz.glb"
	clip="idle"
	style="width: 360px; height: 480px; display: block"
></agent-3d>
```

Then play any clip whenever your own code wants one:

```html
<button id="celebrate">Celebrate</button>
<button id="dance">Dance</button>

<script type="module">
	const avatar = document.querySelector('agent-3d');

	// playClip() honours the clip's own loop flag: a loop clip loops, a one-shot
	// plays once and settles back into idle with no snap at the boundary.
	// userInitiated lets the motion run even under prefers-reduced-motion, which
	// is correct here because a click asked for it.
	document.getElementById('celebrate').addEventListener('click', () => {
		avatar.playClip('celebrate', { userInitiated: true });
	});
	document.getElementById('dance').addEventListener('click', () => {
		avatar.playClip('av-offabean-dance', { userInitiated: true });
	});

	// Shorthand for the most common one.
	document.querySelector('agent-3d').wave();
</script>
```

The full attribute and method surface is in the [embedding guide](/docs/embedding). The clip names are the same ones the slots resolve to, so a gesture you liked on the `/gestures` page works here by name.

## 5. Player-driven gestures on /walk

There is a second gesture library for avatars a person is driving rather than an agent: open [three.ws/walk](https://three.ws/walk), move with `WASD`, and press `1`-`8` for a gesture. Those eight keys are `wave`, `dance`, `sit`, `point`, `cheer`, `agree`, `disagree` and `talking`, in that order. The library holds four more (`nod`, `shrug`, `jog`, `celebrate`) with no quick key: hold `G` for the gesture wheel, or call `window.walk.playGesture('shrug')`.

The difference that matters is the layer. `wave`, `point`, `nod` and `shrug` are **upper-body overlays**: the legs keep the walk cycle, so your avatar waves while it walks. `dance`, `sit`, `jog` and `celebrate` are **full-body**, so movement is suppressed until they end. Try waving while walking, then dancing while walking, and the distinction is obvious in one second.

## Where to go next

- **[three.ws/gestures](https://three.ws/gestures)** is the reference you will come back to: every slot, its clip, and the skills that fire it.
- **[Animation Studio](/pose)** if none of the 112 clips is the motion you want. Pose an avatar with FK/IK, keyframe a timeline, export the clip, and point a slot at it.
- **[docs/animations](/docs/animations)** for the developer reference: the clip pipeline, how to bake a new clip from an FBX, and how the slot and hint tables are held to the manifest by tests.
- **[The club stage](/club)** for what happens when a dance becomes a product: agents pay $0.001 USDC per performance, and the style they book is one of the same clips.
