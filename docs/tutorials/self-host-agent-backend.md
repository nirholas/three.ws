# Self-Host the Agent Backend

By the end of this tutorial you have a fully independent three.ws stack running on infrastructure you control — your front-end, your serverless functions, your model-provider proxies, your wallet keys. The hosted platform at `three.ws` is the reference deployment, not a dependency. This walkthrough takes you from a clean machine to a production deployment you operate end-to-end.

This is the heaviest tutorial in the Advanced tier. It's worth doing in full if you need data residency, custom compliance, fork-friendly customizations, or simply the freedom to ship a feature without waiting for the upstream maintainers.

**What you'll build:**

- A local development setup running the full stack (front-end + Vercel functions + Cloudflare workers + database)
- A production deployment on Vercel under a custom domain
- Cloudflare workers proxying Anthropic and OpenAI traffic with your own keys
- An `agent-3d.js` embed script served from your CDN, so embeds on third-party sites point at *your* infrastructure
- The full set of environment variables wired correctly across local, preview, and production
- A hardening pass: CORS, rate limiting, secret hygiene, audit logging

**Prerequisites:**

- Node.js **24.x** installed locally (the platform's `engines.node` is `24.x`; older versions miss APIs used by some scripts)
- `git`, `npm`, `gh` (GitHub CLI)
- A GitHub account
- A Vercel account, with `vercel` CLI installed: `npm i -g vercel`
- A Cloudflare account with **Workers** enabled (the free plan is enough to start; bump to Paid before you go over 100k requests/day)
- Anthropic API key (`https://console.anthropic.com`)
- OpenAI API key (`https://platform.openai.com`)
- Coinbase Developer Platform account and API key for the x402 facilitator (`https://portal.cdp.coinbase.com`)
- A Solana RPC endpoint — Helius (`https://www.helius.dev`) or Alchemy work; the public `api.mainnet-beta.solana.com` is too rate-limited for production
- A Postgres database (Vercel Postgres, Neon, or Supabase all work); the schema is in `api/_lib/schema.sql`
- A domain you control (optional for local dev, required for production)
- ~$10 of operational budget for the first month (Vercel free tier is generous; the cost floor is mostly Postgres and Solana RPC)

---

## Step 1 — Understand the moving parts

The platform is intentionally composed of small, independently deployable services. Before you touch the repo, know what you're deploying:

**Front-end (Vite + vanilla JS modules).** A static SPA built into `dist/`. Served as static files from Vercel. No SSR. The viewer, editor, and dashboard all live here. Source under `src/`.

**Serverless functions (Vercel).** Everything under `api/`. Each `.js` file is a Vercel function. These handle: agent CRUD, MCP server endpoint, x402 paid endpoints, ERC-8004 prep/confirm flows, Pump.fun integration, OAuth callbacks, signed-URL avatar storage, etc. The file path is the route — `api/agents.js` becomes `/api/agents`.

**Cloudflare workers (`workers/`).** Edge proxies in front of model providers. The two important ones are:

- A general LLM proxy that fronts Anthropic and OpenAI: rate-limits per agent, redacts logs, and lets you swap keys without redeploying the platform
- A Pump.fun MCP worker that maintains live websocket connections to the Pump.fun program (Vercel functions can't hold long-lived sockets cheaply)

**Database (Postgres).** Stores agents, manifests, accounts, sessions, audit logs, skill access grants, x402 receipts. Schema is checked in.

**Object storage (Cloudflare R2 or S3-compatible).** Stores uploaded GLBs, generated avatars, signed cache artifacts. Configured via `api/_lib/r2.js`.

**SDKs (`sdk/`, `agent-payments-sdk/`, `solana-agent-sdk/`).** Published as npm packages. These are not deployed; they're built and published independently for skill authors to consume.

**CDN (`/cdn/agent-3d.js`).** A single-file embed bundle built by `npm run build` and served from the same Vercel deployment. Third-party sites embed this script tag and your domain ends up in their `<script src="...">`.

Everything except the database and Cloudflare workers can live on a single Vercel project. The minimum production deployment is: 1 Vercel project, 1 Cloudflare worker, 1 Postgres database, 1 R2 bucket.

---

## Step 2 — Fork and clone

The codebase mirrors to two GitHub remotes. For your fork you only need one — pick whichever you want as your origin:

- `https://github.com/nirholas/three.ws`
- `https://github.com/nirholas/3D-Agent`

Both contain identical code. Fork on GitHub via the CLI:

```bash
gh repo fork nirholas/three.ws --clone=true --remote=true
cd three.ws
```

This drops you into the cloned fork with your remote set to `origin`. Add the upstream so you can pull updates later:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/nirholas/three.ws
git fetch upstream
```

Now install everything. The workspace includes a couple of npm workspaces and a postinstall script that builds the agent-payments SDK:

```bash
npm ci
```

If `npm ci` fails on a workspace, the most common cause is Node version mismatch. Run `node --version` and confirm it starts with `v24`. If you're on 22 or 23, install Node 24:

```bash
# nvm
nvm install 24 && nvm use 24

# or volta
volta install node@24
```

Then `rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json` and `npm install`.

---

## Step 3 — Provision the database

The Postgres schema is `api/_lib/schema.sql`. Pick a hosted Postgres provider:

**Neon (recommended for first deploy).** Free tier, instant provisioning, branch databases for previews.

```bash
# Create an account at https://neon.tech, create a project, then:
npx neonctl auth
npx neonctl projects create --name three-ws-fork
npx neonctl connection-string --project-id <project-id>
```

Copy the connection string. It looks like `postgresql://user:pass@host/db?sslmode=require`.

**Vercel Postgres.** If you're going production-first, link it directly when you create your Vercel project. Vercel injects `POSTGRES_URL` automatically.

**Supabase.** Works fine; use the "transaction" pooler URL, not the direct URL, to avoid connection limits in serverless.

Once you have a connection string, run the schema:

```bash
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f api/_lib/schema.sql
```

Confirm the tables exist:

```bash
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "\dt"
```

You should see tables like `agents`, `accounts`, `sessions`, `audit_log`, `x402_receipts`, `skill_grants`, etc.

---

## Step 4 — Provision object storage

Avatars and GLB uploads need somewhere to live. Cloudflare R2 is the default — S3-compatible, no egress fees, integrates well with Cloudflare Workers.

```bash
# Install wrangler (the Cloudflare CLI)
npm i -g wrangler
wrangler login

# Create a bucket
wrangler r2 bucket create three-ws-fork-assets

# Generate an S3-compatible API token at:
# https://dash.cloudflare.com → R2 → Manage R2 API Tokens → Create
# Save the Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, and the endpoint URL
```

You'll get an endpoint like `https://<account-id>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com`. Note it — you'll need it in env vars below.

---

## Step 5 — Create your local environment file

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.development`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.development
```

Open `.env.development` and fill in the values. The file is long; here's the irreducible minimum to get local dev running:

```env
# Front-end
VITE_API_BASE=http://localhost:3000

# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...

# Object storage
R2_ENDPOINT=https://<account-id>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com
R2_BUCKET=three-ws-fork-assets
R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<from cloudflare>
R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<from cloudflare>
R2_PUBLIC_BASE=https://pub-<id>.r2.dev   # the bucket's public hostname

# Model providers (used by the chat function and the worker proxy)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

# Solana RPC (free public RPC is fine for local; switch in production)
SOLANA_RPC_URL=https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com
HELIUS_API_KEY=                       # optional but useful

# x402 facilitator routing
X402_PAY_TO_BASE=0xYourBaseReceiverAddress
X402_ASSET_ADDRESS_BASE=0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913
X402_MAX_AMOUNT_REQUIRED=1000
CDP_API_KEY_ID=
CDP_API_KEY_SECRET=
X402_CDP_FACILITATOR_URL=https://api.cdp.coinbase.com/platform/v2/x402
X402_FACILITATOR_URL_BASE=https://facilitator.payai.network
X402_FACILITATOR_URL_SOLANA=https://facilitator.payai.network

# Session/CSRF secrets — generate fresh with `openssl rand -hex 32`
SESSION_SECRET=<random hex>
CSRF_SECRET=<random hex>

# Cloudflare worker URLs (set after Step 7)
LLM_WORKER_URL=
PUMPFUN_MCP_WORKER_URL=
```

The exhaustive list of env vars is in `.env.example`. Most are optional — you can leave them empty until you need the feature they unlock. For example, you don't need `HELIUS_API_KEY` to run an agent; you only need it if you're enabling the Pump.fun live feed.

Do **not** commit `.env.development`. It's in `.gitignore` already; double-check with `git status`.

---

## Step 6 — Run it locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

This boots Vite on port 3000 with the API functions proxied through Vercel's local dev (the project uses Vite's dev server alongside Vercel's function emulator via `vercel dev`-style integration baked into the dev script).

In another terminal, sanity-check the API:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/healthz
```

You should see `{"ok": true}` or similar.

Now open `http://localhost:3000` in a browser. You should land on the platform's home page. Click into the editor — drag any GLB onto it — confirm the avatar loads. Open DevTools → Console. **There should be no red errors.** If there are, the most common causes:

- Database tables missing → re-run the schema in Step 3
- R2 misconfigured → uploads fail with a 500; check the response body
- LLM env vars unset → the chat input shows but messages return 500; set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and reload

If the avatar loads and you can send a chat message that gets a real model response, your local stack is healthy.

---

## Step 7 — Deploy the Cloudflare workers

The LLM proxy worker lives at `workers/` (alongside the strategy executor). The proxy is responsible for:

- Holding the production Anthropic/OpenAI keys server-side
- Rate-limiting per agent (so a runaway agent doesn't bankrupt your provider budget)
- Streaming responses back to the browser
- Stripping or appending headers as required

Configure and deploy:

```bash
cd workers
cp wrangler.example.toml wrangler.toml
```

Edit `wrangler.toml` and fill in your worker name and the secrets bindings. The example file lists the required vars: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, plus optional Helius keys for the Pump.fun worker.

Set secrets via wrangler (don't put them in `wrangler.toml`):

```bash
wrangler secret put ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
wrangler secret put OPENAI_API_KEY
```

Deploy:

```bash
wrangler deploy
```

You'll get a URL like `https://three-ws-llm.<account>.workers.dev`. Put that into your `.env.development` and (later) your Vercel project as `LLM_WORKER_URL`.

If you're running the Pump.fun feed, repeat for `workers/pump-fun-mcp/`.

---

## Step 8 — Build for production

Confirm the production build works before deploying:

```bash
npm run build
```

This builds:

- The Vite front-end into `dist/`
- The `agent-3d.js` CDN bundle into `dist/cdn/agent-3d.js`
- The chat sub-app into `dist/chat/`
- The artifact viewer into `dist/artifact-viewer/`

Look at `dist/` — there should be an `index.html`, a hashed bundle, the `cdn/` folder, and the various sub-apps. If the build prints warnings about missing env vars (e.g., `VITE_*` vars that the front-end reads at build time), set them before re-running:

```bash
VITE_API_BASE=https://<your-domain>.vercel.app npm run build
```

For preview/staging builds the API base can point at the preview deployment; for production, point it at the final domain.

---

## Step 9 — Create the Vercel project

```bash
vercel login
vercel link        # link your local dir to a new Vercel project
```

When prompted, accept the defaults (the project's `vercel.json` already configures the build and routes correctly).

Now copy your env vars into Vercel. The CLI takes them one at a time or in bulk:

```bash
# One at a time, scoped to production
vercel env add DATABASE_URL production
# (paste the value when prompted)

# Or import all from a file (one VAR=value per line)
cat .env.production | vercel env import production
```

A few env vars that have to be set per-environment:

- `VITE_API_BASE` — must be the public URL of *that* environment (preview, production, etc.)
- `SESSION_SECRET`, `CSRF_SECRET` — use **different secrets per environment**. Don't reuse production secrets in preview.
- `X402_PAY_TO_BASE` — use **different wallets per environment** so you can identify which environment generated which receipt.

Deploy a preview to validate:

```bash
vercel
```

Vercel will print a preview URL. Hit `/api/healthz` on it. Confirm. Then promote to production:

```bash
vercel --prod
```

You now have a production deployment at `https://<project-name>.vercel.app`.

---

## Step 10 — Wire your custom domain

Open the Vercel project → Settings → Domains. Add your domain (e.g., `agent.yourcompany.com`).

Vercel will show DNS instructions: typically a CNAME pointing at `cname.vercel-dns.com`. Add the record in your DNS provider. SSL is issued automatically once DNS resolves.

For the apex domain (e.g., `yourcompany.com`), Vercel needs an A record to its IPs — those are listed in the same dialog.

Within 5–60 minutes the domain resolves and HTTPS works. Test:

```bash
curl -I https://agent.yourcompany.com/api/healthz
```

You should get a 200. If you get a 526 or 525 (SSL handshake errors), DNS hasn't fully propagated yet; wait 10 minutes and retry. If you get a 404, check that the Vercel project's domain settings show your domain as primary.

See [deploy-to-vercel-custom-domain](/tutorials/deploy-to-vercel-custom-domain) for the full DNS/SSL flow including the apex-domain edge cases.

---

## Step 11 — Swap the CDN domain

Up to this point, anyone embedding an agent from your platform is including `<script src="https://three.ws/cdn/agent-3d.js" ...>`. The script tag is generated by the editor's "Copy embed" button, which by default emits the three.ws URL.

For *your* deployment, the embed should point at *your* CDN. Two changes:

**1. Front-end build constant.** The embed-generator UI reads its CDN base from a build-time constant. Set `VITE_CDN_BASE` to your domain when building:

```bash
VITE_CDN_BASE=https://agent.yourcompany.com npm run build
```

Re-deploy. Now every "Copy embed" output from your dashboard emits `<script src="https://agent.yourcompany.com/cdn/agent-3d.js" ...>`.

**2. The script itself self-locates.** Open `src/embed/agent-3d-bundle.js` (or the equivalent in your fork — the file the build emits to `dist/cdn/agent-3d.js`). The bundle reads its own `currentScript.src` to derive the API base for fetches. This means a third party who pastes your embed on `their-site.com` will have the script fetch agents from *your* domain, not theirs, and you can move infrastructure later without breaking existing embeds.

Verify with a smoke test: create a static HTML file and paste your embed:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <body>
    <script
      src="https://agent.yourcompany.com/cdn/agent-3d.js"
      data-agent-id="your-test-agent-id"
      id="test-embed"
    ></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Open it in a browser. The agent should load and chat correctly. Check the Network tab — every request (manifest fetch, model fetch, chat) should hit `agent.yourcompany.com`, not `three.ws`.

---

## Step 12 — Hardening: CORS

`api/_lib/http.js` exposes a `cors()` helper used by every paid route. The default policy is permissive (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`) because the platform is designed to be embedded from anywhere. That's the right call for the public CDN script and for x402 endpoints (anyone with a wallet should be able to pay you).

For **internal** routes that shouldn't be called cross-origin — admin actions, account routes, the dashboard API — tighten CORS to your domain:

```js
import { cors } from '../_lib/http.js';

export default async function handler(req, res) {
  if (cors(req, res, {
    origin: 'https://agent.yourcompany.com',
    methods: 'GET,POST,OPTIONS',
    credentials: true,
  })) return;
  // ... handler
}
```

Audit which routes are sensitive. A simple rule: anything that uses the session cookie (`api/auth/*`, `api/dashboard/*`, account-scoped writes) should restrict CORS to your domain.

---

## Step 13 — Hardening: rate limits

`api/_lib/rate-limit.js` exposes `limits.<bucket>(key)`. Buckets are named (`mcpIp`, `mcpUser`, `chatIp`, etc.) and back into Upstash Redis or a local in-memory fallback.

Set Upstash:

```env
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=https://<your-instance>.upstash.io
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=<token>
```

Rate-limit buckets you almost always want on production:

- `chatIp` — the public chat endpoint, throttled by client IP
- `mcpIp` and `mcpUser` — the MCP server (the production code in `api/mcp.js` already calls both)
- A custom bucket for any x402 endpoint, keyed by the payer wallet — see [paid-x402-endpoint](/tutorials/paid-x402-endpoint)

Without Redis, the in-memory fallback works for a single Vercel function instance but doesn't share state across cold starts. It will not protect you against a determined attacker. Set up Upstash before going public.

---

## Step 14 — Hardening: secret hygiene

A few non-negotiables for the env vars you just set:

- **Never commit any of them.** `.env.development`, `.env.preview`, `.env.production` are all gitignored. Confirm with `git check-ignore .env.production`.
- **Rotate on personnel changes.** If anyone with access leaves the project, rotate `SESSION_SECRET`, `CSRF_SECRET`, the LLM keys, and the wallet private keys.
- **Use separate keys per environment.** Don't share `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` between local dev and production — it makes log attribution impossible and one buggy local script can torch the production rate-limit window.
- **Sweep wallet balances.** `X402_PAY_TO_BASE` receives USDC. Sweep to a cold address daily or set up an automated sweep transaction.
- **CDP keys are sensitive.** Treat them like AWS keys. Coinbase rotates them via the dashboard at any time.

---

## Step 15 — Hardening: audit logging

`api/_lib/audit.js` writes structured records to the `audit_log` table. The platform already writes audit entries for: agent creation, manifest changes, on-chain registrations, x402 payments, skill grants, account-level writes.

In your fork, you'll add audit entries for your own routes:

```js
import { audit } from './_lib/audit.js';

await audit({
  actor: auth.userId,        // or wallet address, or null for unauthenticated
  action: 'custom.action',
  target: targetId,
  meta: { request: summarize(req.body) },
});
```

Hard rule: every mutation to a user-visible record must produce an audit row. The point isn't compliance for its own sake — it's that when something weird happens (a manifest gets corrupted, a wallet drains, an admin role is granted), the audit trail is the only artifact that survives.

Export the audit log to long-term storage if your compliance demands it. The schema is plain Postgres; `pg_dump` works.

---

## Step 16 — Promote-preview workflow

Your deployment now supports three environments:

- **Local** — `npm run dev`, fed by `.env.development`
- **Preview** — every `vercel` deploy (or every PR on the main branch via the Vercel/GitHub integration) generates a preview URL with `.env.preview` values
- **Production** — `vercel --prod` (or merging to `main`) deploys with `.env.production` values

The recommended workflow:

1. Develop locally against `.env.development` and a Neon branch database
2. Open a PR — Vercel auto-deploys a preview with `.env.preview` and a separate Neon preview branch
3. Run smoke tests against the preview (real APIs, real database, real wallets, but isolated from production)
4. Merge to `main` — production deploys automatically

The CI workflow lives under `.github/workflows/` in the upstream repo. Inherit it on your fork, then customize as needed (`typecheck.yml`, `test.yml`, anything else specific to you).

---

## Step 17 — Pulling upstream updates

The upstream three.ws repo ships fixes and features regularly. Pull them with:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main
# resolve conflicts (typically none if you've stayed close to upstream)
npm ci
npm run build      # confirm it still builds
git push origin main
```

Vercel auto-redeploys. New schema migrations (if any) land in `api/_lib/migrations/` — re-run them against your database. The repo uses simple forward-only SQL migrations; check the directory's README for the runner script.

If you've forked aggressively and diverged, you may want to keep your changes in a long-running `your-company/main` branch and merge from `upstream/main` periodically with a clear strategy (e.g., quarterly cadence, with a dedicated "merge upstream" PR).

---

## Step 18 — Operational checklist

Before you point real traffic at your deployment, walk through this list. If any item is unchecked, fix it first.

- All env vars set in production and preview (`vercel env ls`)
- `npm run build` passes locally with production env
- `/api/healthz` returns 200 on the production URL
- A test agent can be created, edited, saved, and embedded
- The LLM proxy worker is deployed and `LLM_WORKER_URL` points to it
- A test chat message gets a real model response in production
- Database schema matches `api/_lib/schema.sql` (run `pg_dump --schema-only` and diff)
- Upstash rate-limiting is wired (or you have a clear plan for when to add it)
- `X402_PAY_TO_BASE` is a wallet you control and the private key is held securely (hardware wallet, KMS, or equivalent — *not* in plaintext anywhere)
- CDP keys are set so x402 settlements route through CDP (otherwise endpoints don't get cataloged in agentic.market)
- Audit logging writes to `audit_log` for at least the core mutations
- A monitoring/alerting service (Vercel's built-in observability is the floor; add Sentry, Better Stack, or Honeycomb for real visibility) is hooked up
- Backup strategy for the database: Neon and Vercel Postgres both do automatic PITR; confirm yours does
- Domain has working HTTPS, all `https://three.ws/...` URLs have been replaced with your domain throughout the front-end, and the CDN bundle correctly self-locates to your domain

---

## Step 19 — What happens when the upstream breaks (and other realities)

A few things you should know going in:

**The upstream is the reference.** When the three.ws hosted platform ships a feature, the source is in the public repo within hours or days. Your fork can adopt it on your schedule. There is no private code path.

**Some upstream features require platform-only secrets.** The hosted three.ws has access to API keys and wallets that aren't published. If you fork, those features (e.g., the platform-managed agent treasury) won't work as-is — you'll either disable them or wire your own equivalents. The code paths that depend on platform secrets are clearly conditional on env-var presence; if your env var is empty, the feature is hidden in the UI.

**You become responsible for security patches.** Vercel handles its own infrastructure. You handle the application code. Subscribe to GitHub Dependabot alerts on your fork. The repo lists Apache-2.0 as its license — you can ship patches yourself, but you should also feed them upstream if they're not specific to your deployment.

**Cost shapes:**

- Vercel: free tier for low traffic; ~$20/month per project once you cross the free limits; bandwidth is the lever
- Neon Postgres: free for the first few GB; $19/month for the next tier
- Cloudflare R2: ~$15/TB/month, no egress fees
- Cloudflare Workers: free for the first 100k requests/day; $5/month + small per-request fees beyond
- LLM tokens: order-of-magnitude bigger than infrastructure. Watch Anthropic/OpenAI bills, not Vercel.
- Solana RPC: Helius free tier covers significant usage; $50/month for the next tier

A self-hosted instance with light traffic runs at $20–50/month all-in. The dominant cost as you grow is LLM tokens.
