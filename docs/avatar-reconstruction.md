# Selfie → Avatar Reconstruction

This is the subsystem that turns a **user's photo** into a rigged,
animation-ready 3D avatar. A **text prompt** sent to the same endpoint does NOT
use this pipeline: fitting a face onto a template body ignores everything a
prompt says about outfit, build, and style, so prompts run the full-body lane
instead (a full-body reference image, reconstructed on the self-hosted Hunyuan3D
worker, then auto-rigged). The lane plan lives in
[`api/_lib/prompt-avatar.js`](../api/_lib/prompt-avatar.js); both inputs share
the job contract, the status poll, and the finalize tail described below. It is distinct from the Forge
generation lane in the [Avatar Pipeline](avatar-pipeline.md): the Forge generates
an *arbitrary* mesh from a prompt, whereas reconstruction fits a *specific
person* onto a fixed, pre-rigged template — the same architecture Avaturn and
Ready Player Me use, and the reason the output is born-rigged with facial
blendshapes instead of a bare mesh that still needs auto-rigging.

- **Worker:** [`workers/avatar-reconstruction/`](../workers/avatar-reconstruction): FastAPI on a CPU-only Cloud Run service (8 vCPU). It ran on an L4 until background removal was measured to gain nothing from CUDA; see the comment in its `cloudbuild.yaml`.
- **Backend provider:** [`api/_providers/gcp.js`](../api/_providers/gcp.js), selected by `AVATAR_REGEN_PROVIDER=gcp` (see [`api/_lib/regen-provider.js`](../api/_lib/regen-provider.js)).
- **User entry points:** the selfie/upload flow (and, via the full-body lane, the text→avatar prompt flow) in [`api/avatars/_actions.js`](../api/avatars/_actions.js) (`POST /api/avatars/reconstruct`).
- **Completion:** normally driven by the browser polling `/api/avatars/regenerate-status`, which runs the finalize stages inline. [`api/cron/reconstruct-sweep.js`](../api/cron/reconstruct-sweep.js) is the server-side backstop for when it isn't — see below.

## Who finishes the job

A reconstruct job is advanced by whoever polls it. The `/create/selfie` page
polls every few seconds, and each poll pulls provider status and runs the shared
finalize stages in [`reconstruct-finalize.js`](../api/_lib/reconstruct-finalize.js).

That made the browser tab load-bearing. Close it mid-build and the worker still
finished the GLB and stored it durably in GCS, but nothing ever collected it: the
job row stayed `queued`/`running` forever and the avatar never reached the user's
library. Production had 26 jobs stranded that way, the oldest from 2026-05-31,
invisible to `db-retention` (which only prunes terminal rows).

`reconstruct-sweep` closes that hole. Every 5 minutes it picks up reconstruct
jobs quiet for over 3 minutes and runs **the same finalize stages** the browser
poll would have, so an abandoned job still lands in the library. Design notes:

- **30-day rescue window**, far longer than the auto-rig sweep's 6 hours. The
  worker's GLBs (GCS) and job state (Firestore) are both durable, so a weeks-old
  abandoned job is still genuinely deliverable to a real user.
- Past that window, and for jobs whose provider is no longer pollable with
  platform credentials, rows are failed out with an honest reason — the open set
  must not grow without bound.
- **BYOK jobs (meshy/tripo) stay browser-driven.** They authenticate with the
  user's own key, which the status poll resolves from request context; a cron has
  no user context to decrypt it. They age out via the same window.
- A provider 404 (`gcp_task_missing`) is terminal here, so a job whose worker
  record is genuinely gone resolves instead of being retried forever.

## Object storage cannot take the avatar away

The last step of finalize copies the finished GLB from the worker's bucket into
ours. That single `putObject` used to sit between the user and the avatar they
had already waited ninety seconds for: when the R2 credential stopped verifying
at 03:15 UTC on 2026-09-11, materialize aborted, no avatar row was written, and
the page could only say "Avatar finished but could not be saved. Try again."
Retrying never worked, because the photo was never the problem.

The mesh was never lost. The reconstruction worker parks it in
`gs://three-ws-avatar-reconstructions`, which is public and lifecycle-free, and
that URL is already in the job row. So `storeGlbOrKeepProviderUrl` in
[`reconstruct-finalize.js`](../api/_lib/reconstruct-finalize.js) now lets a
*named* storage-infrastructure fault (`isStorageInfrastructureError`: credential
rejected or revoked, bucket missing, endpoint unreachable) cost the durable copy
in our bucket rather than the user's avatar. The provider's absolute https URL
becomes the storage key: `publicUrl()` passes an absolute key straight through,
`copyObject()` declines to copy one, `defaultStorageMode()` records
`r2.present = false` instead of claiming bytes that are not there, and
`source_meta` carries `servedFrom` plus the `pendingBucketKey` a later re-copy
needs. Any other error still throws, so only a fault we can name is allowed to
degrade.

## Plan quotas are checked twice, on purpose

A reconstruction only meets the caller's plan quota at the very end, inside
`createAvatar` → `enforceQuotas`. That is roughly ninety seconds of GPU time
after the button was pressed (plus a Flux reference image on the text→avatar
lane), and a refusal there used to leave the job at `done` with no
`resultAvatarId`: a state no recovery cron looks at (they filter on
`queued`/`running`), which re-ran the same doomed materialization on every poll
and reported the generic engine-fault copy to the browser. The user was told the
engine had a problem, and every retry burned the same spend to land in the same
place.

Two checks now bracket the job:

1. **Pre-flight, at submit.** `POST /api/avatars/reconstruct` calls
   `assertAvatarSlotAvailable(userId)` ([`api/_lib/avatars.js`](../api/_lib/avatars.js))
   before it resolves a provider or generates a reference image. A full library
   is refused in milliseconds with `402 plan_limit` and an actionable
   `error_description`. This is the check that fires in practice.
2. **At materialization, for the race.** If another avatar lands while the mesh
   is generating, the finalize stage still throws. `failJobOnPlanLimit` then
   ends the job as `failed` with `error_kind = 'input'`, so
   `/api/avatars/regenerate-status` relays the plan copy verbatim (see
   [REGENERATE.md](../api/avatars/REGENERATE.md)) instead of masking it as an
   engine fault.

Only the per-plan avatar count and the total-bytes ceiling can be pre-flighted:
per-file size is unknowable until the mesh exists, so `plan_limit_size` remains a
materialization-time refusal.

## How it works

The avatar is a fixed-topology Wolf3D/RPM template that ships **pre-rigged** with
a humanoid skeleton and **52 ARKit blendshapes + 15 visemes**. Reconstruction
never generates a new mesh; it fits the person onto that template in two phases.

### Phase 1 — Face texture transfer

`face_pipeline.py`: MediaPipe FaceLandmarker finds 468 landmarks on the best
frontal photo, a thin-plate-spline warp maps the face into the template's skin-UV
space, it is composited over the face-oval region, and skin / hair / eye colours
are sampled and tinted for consistency. Output: the template body wearing the
person's face *texture*.

### Phase 2 — Face geometry morph

Texture alone leaves the *shape* generic — same jaw, nose, brow and face width as
the template, so the avatar looks like a sticker on a mannequin. `face_geometry.py`
closes that gap:

1. Umeyama similarity-aligns the 468 detected landmarks onto MediaPipe's neutral
   **canonical face model**, so the person's face and the reference share a frame.
2. The residual `(person − canonical)` on a **stable identity subset** (face
   oval, nose, cheeks, brow, jaw — expression-prone eye/lip points excluded) is
   the person's shape deviation from neutral.
3. That displacement is carried onto the head's corresponding vertices (a
   nearest-vertex map precomputed by `precompute_uv.py`), scaled into head units,
   and clamped to reject landmark/pose outliers.
4. A **thin-plate spline** interpolates the sparse displacements across all 2162
   head vertices. TPS passes exactly through its control points, so localised
   identity (a wider jaw, a longer nose) survives instead of being averaged away
   — the failure mode of normalised-Gaussian/Shepard weighting. TPS extrapolates
   freely, so a Gaussian locality mask fades the field to zero off the face and
   the scalp, ears and neck stay put.

`strength` and `max_displacement_frac` default to **0.6 / 0.55**, chosen by two
sweeps over the 40-face reference set, not by eye: `python -m eval.tune_morph`
(mean ISE, is the shape right?) and `python -m eval.robustness` (does a degraded
photo of the same person still give the same head?). 0.55 sits at the knee of
that fidelity-vs-robustness curve, cutting mean ISE 46% against the original
0.75 / 0.18, whose ~1.9 cm displacement ceiling was throttling genuine facial
variation rather than rejecting outliers; past 0.65 fidelity flatlines while
instability keeps rising. See [avatar-fidelity-program.md](avatar-fidelity-program.md)
for why the sweep's own looser optimum was deliberately not shipped.

Because vertex count and order never change, `glb_ops.set_head_geometry` writes
the morphed positions (and recomputed normals) back **without disturbing the
skinning weights or any of the 67 blendshape morph targets** — the rig and every
ARKit expression survive intact. This is verified end-to-end in
[`test_face_geometry.py`](../workers/avatar-reconstruction/test_face_geometry.py).

Toggle Phase 2 with the `GEOMETRY_MORPH` env var (default `1`). It degrades
cleanly to texture-only if anything fails; the shape refinement never fails a job.

### Phase 3: projective texturing (the rest of the head)

Phases 1 and 2 both stop at the face. The face-oval polygon Phase 1 composites
into is only **10.4% of the head's texels** (9.4% of its surface area), because
MediaPipe's 468 landmarks are face-only: there are no ear, scalp or neck points,
so outside the oval there is no correspondence to warp with. Everything else was
template texture personalised by a single global skin tint.

[`face_projection.py`](../workers/avatar-reconstruction/face_projection.py) takes
the other route. Phase 2 leaves us the head's real 3D shape, which turns the
problem from *find matching points* into *find where each surface point lands in
the photo*:

1. **Fit the camera** with a closed-form Umeyama similarity between the head's
   landmark vertices and MediaPipe's *3D* landmarks. This is the only use of
   landmarks, and they locate the camera rather than establishing surface
   correspondence.

   This started as `cv2.solvePnP` and had to be replaced, which is worth
   recording. `landmark_vtx` is nearest-vertex and **many-to-one**: on the
   shipped template, 468 landmarks collapse onto just **262 distinct head
   vertices**, so hundreds of landmarks share one 3D point while sitting at
   different 2D positions. That is a contradiction no camera can satisfy.
   Measured on the reference faces, RANSAC found 25-35% inliers and returned a
   solution *behind the camera* on half of them, with the depth sign flipping
   between runs and coordinate conventions.

   Because MediaPipe reports 3D landmarks, the alignment is 3D-to-3D rather than
   2D-to-3D, and Umeyama solves it in closed form with a reflection guard: no
   RANSAC, no depth-sign ambiguity, nothing that can diverge. Duplicate
   correspondences are averaged first so a vertex is not weighted by how many
   landmarks happened to land on it. The result is a weak-perspective (scaled
   orthographic) camera, which is the right model for a selfie anyway: head
   depth is centimetres against a camera distance of tens, so foreshortening
   across the head is small. **10 of 10 reference faces now fit**, against 50%
   failure with PnP.
2. **Rasterize the head in UV space** so every texel carries its 3D position and
   normal.
3. **Project and sample.** Each texel's 3D position goes through the camera into
   the photo. Ears, jawline and neck fall out for free.

Four gates decide whether a texel may be painted at all, because projection will
otherwise paint the back of a head with whatever pixel lies behind it. The texel
must land inside the photo, face the camera (confidence falls off as
cos^1.5 of the view angle), survive a depth-buffer occlusion test that catches
the nose shadowing the cheek, and sample a foreground pixel per the rembg alpha.
A texel failing any gate keeps its existing colour rather than inventing one. The
result blends *under* the Phase 1 composite, which stays authoritative where the
landmark warp applies, and is capped at `MAX_BLEND = 0.85` so a slightly-wrong
pose degrades to a tint rather than a visibly wrong image.

Measured on the shipped template by
[`eval/measure_projection_coverage.py`](../workers/avatar-reconstruction/eval/measure_projection_coverage.py),
photographic coverage of the head rises from **10.5% to 41.1%, a 3.9x increase**
across the 40-face reference set: the face oval keeps its 10.5% and projection
adds 30.6% of ears, jawline, neck and forehead that no landmark describes. All
40 faces fit a camera; per-face coverage ranges 33.9% to 42.1%.

Toggle with `PROJECTIVE_TEXTURE` (default `1`). Like the morph, it degrades
cleanly: a pose that will not solve logs and leaves the warp-only skin in place.
It runs *after* the geometry morph, since projecting onto the template and then
morphing would slide the texture off the features it was sampled from.

## Licensing — why this stack

Every stage is commercial-clean (Apache-2.0 / MIT / CC0). The dominant constraint
in single-image avatar reconstruction is that the best-known 3D face and body
models are **non-commercial**: FLAME and the Basel Face Model (BFM) are academic
licences, and the whole SMPL/SMPL-X family is Max-Planck non-commercial. Anything
built on them (DECA, EMOCA, MICA, ICON, ECON, PIFuHD, …) inherits that restriction.
The Phase-2 morph uses only **MediaPipe Face Mesh** (Apache-2.0) — no 3DMM — so it
is unencumbered.

## Roadmap — beating Avaturn on fidelity

> The active plan built on this roadmap — tracks, owners, capacity and credit
> allocation — is [avatar-fidelity-program.md](avatar-fidelity-program.md).
> Fidelity claims are scored with the ISE metric in
> [`workers/avatar-reconstruction/eval/`](../workers/avatar-reconstruction/eval/README.md).

Phase 2 captures gross face identity (proportions, projection) but not fine
geometry. The path to and past Avaturn quality, with the verified licence for
each link:

| Version | Upgrade | Model | Licence verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| **v1 (shipped)** | Real face-shape morph (sparse) | MediaPipe Face Mesh | Apache-2.0 — clean |
| **v2 (recommended)** | Dense identity geometry, fused via `register_head_to_target` | **MICA + FLAME**, commercial licence from MPI | Paid MPI commercial licence — clean once signed. FLAME's fixed topology + expression basis map straight to ARKit |
| **v2 (fallback)** | Dense identity, no licence fee | HRN re-based on **FLAME-2023-Open** (CC-BY-4.0) | Clean, but weeks of GPU R&D to retrain the identity regressor |
| **v2 (texture)** SHIPPED | Projective texturing off the morphed mesh: fills ears, jawline and neck from the *same* photo (10.5% to 41.1% of the head) | none, geometry we already have | Clean; no new model or licence |
| **v3 (texture)** | Inpaint what no camera saw (scalp, far cheek) | **Imagen** inpaint on Vertex AI | GCP, pre-approved |
| **v3** | Drop the RPM-template dependency for a fully-owned body | **Anny** (parametric body) + **ICT-FaceKit** (ARKit-52) + deformation transfer | Anny Apache-2.0 + CC0; ICT-FaceKit + DT MIT — clean |

**Rejected: FaceLift (ICCV'25)** — initially floated as the clean v2 model, but
verification killed it: its weights are licensed from Adobe under the
**non-commercial Adobe Research License** (Apache code does not extend to the
weights), and it outputs **3D Gaussian Splats, not a mesh**, so it cannot feed a
rigged-GLB pipeline. This is the recurring trap here: the high-quality
single-image face models are almost all encumbered by a non-commercial 3DMM/
dataset (FLAME, BFM, SMPL) or a non-commercial weight licence. The dense
registration itself (`register_head_to_target`) is model-agnostic and already
validated, so whichever licensed model is chosen drops straight in.

Auto-rigging for the reconstruct-the-whole-body variant would use
**Make-It-Animatable** (Apache) or **UniRig** (MIT) → a Mixamo-standard skeleton
that drives the existing pre-baked clip library. The whole recommended chain runs
on one L4 (24 GB); an A100 is only needed for throughput, not any single stage.

## Deploy

The worker is already provisioned on Cloud Run GPU. From a clean tree:

```bash
gcloud builds submit \
  --config workers/avatar-reconstruction/cloudbuild.yaml \
  --substitutions _GCS_BUCKET=three-ws-avatar-reconstructions,SHORT_SHA=manual$(date +%s)
```

The backend needs no change — Phase 2 ships inside the same image and the
`POST /reconstruct` → `GET /jobs/:id` contract is unchanged. Verify with
`GET /health` (`"pipeline": "face_texture_transfer_v2"`, `"geometry_morph": true`).
