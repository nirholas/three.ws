# x402 Paid Endpoints

three.ws exposes a catalog of HTTP endpoints that charge per call over
[x402](x402.md): the caller hits the endpoint, receives a `402 Payment Required`
challenge, settles a small USDC payment, and retries with an `X-PAYMENT` header to
get the result. This page is the reference for **our own** paid endpoints, their
prices, and the price-override scheme.

To call these as a buyer, see [x402 buyer client](x402-buyer.md). For the loop
that calls many of them on a schedule, see [Autonomous x402 loop](autonomous-x402.md).

## Pricing model

Every endpoint declares a default price in **USDC atomics** (6 decimals, so
`10000` = $0.01). Operators override any price at deploy time:

```
X402_PRICE_<SLUG>=<atomics>
```

where `<SLUG>` is the upper-snake-case form of the endpoint slug — e.g.
`agent-reputation` → `X402_PRICE_AGENT_REPUTATION`, `token-intel` →
`X402_PRICE_TOKEN_INTEL`. A non-integer value logs a warning and falls back to the
default. Defaults are intentionally low (a demo/dev curve); production deployments
should tune them to real unit economics.

## Networks and settlement

Endpoints advertise the networks they accept in the 402 challenge. The platform
settles **USDC on Solana** (primary, always-on via the self-hosted facilitator)
and, when configured, **USDC on Base** (EVM) and a **BSC leg** (contract-mediated
`direct` scheme, advertised only when `X402_PAY_TO_BSC` is set). On the Solana
rail, `X402_ACCEPT_THREE_SOLANA` (on by default) advertises **$THREE** alongside
USDC as a second accept entry on the same challenge; the browser checkout renders a
token chooser whenever a resource quotes more than one asset on a network, so a
buyer can actually pay in either. `paidEndpoint` lists networks Solana first, then
Base; a handler passes `networks` only to narrow that set, and
`tests/x402-solana-first-ordering.test.js` fails any handler that pins a non-Solana
network first. The relevant config (see
[Configuration](configuration.md)):

| Key                                                  | Meaning                              |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `X402_PAY_TO_SOLANA` / `X402_PAY_TO_BASE`            | Receiving address per network.       |
| `X402_ASSET_MINT_SOLANA` / `X402_ASSET_ADDRESS_BASE` | USDC mint / contract.                |
| `X402_FACILITATOR_URL_SOLANA` / `_BASE`              | Facilitator that verifies + settles. |
| `X402_ADVERTISE_BASE`                                | Opt-in to advertise Base without CDP (see below). |
| `X402_RECEIPT_SIGNING_KEY`, `OFFER_RECEIPT_*`        | Signed receipt issuance.             |

**Base is gated on a settleable facilitator.** Solana always leads the 402
challenge. Base is advertised only when it can actually settle — either CDP
credentials are set (`CDP_API_KEY_ID` + `CDP_API_KEY_SECRET`, routing Base to
Coinbase) **or** the operator opts in with `X402_ADVERTISE_BASE=true`. A bare
`X402_FACILITATOR_URL_BASE` being set is deliberately *not* enough: a
decommissioned facilitator answers `/verify` with `404 Application not found`, so
an ungated Base accept would let a buyer pay and then fail settlement with a 502.
The gate (`baseSettleable()` in `x402-spec.js`) keeps such a rail out of both the
live 402 and the discovery catalog until it is provably settleable.

The shared handler in `x402-paid-endpoint.js` builds the challenge
(`buildRequirements()`), verifies the submitted payment, settles it, runs the
endpoint logic, and issues a signed receipt.

### When settlement capacity runs dry

Solana normally settles in sponsor mode: the platform's fee wallet
(`X402_FEE_PAYER_SOLANA`) co-signs and pays the network fee. The
self-facilitator refuses a sponsored settle whenever that wallet would end below
`X402_SPONSOR_SOL_FLOOR_LAMPORTS` (default 0.02 SOL) **after paying the settle's
own cost** (including ~0.00204 SOL of ATA rent when the receiver has never held
the mint), which protects the wallet from being drained to zero mid-flight.

Sponsoring gas is a convenience, not a precondition for being paid. When we
settle in-house (the self-hosted facilitator) and the sponsor cannot co-sign (no
key loaded, or known below its floor), both accept builders (`buildRequirements()`
in `x402-paid-endpoint.js` and `paymentRequirements()` in `x402-spec.js`) keep
advertising the Solana USDC and $THREE accepts **without `extra.feePayer`**. That
is the self-pay contract: the buyer signs as their own fee payer and the
facilitator only broadcasts, spending none of our SOL. Sponsored mode resumes on
its own once the wallet is refunded. Self-pay is never offered when Solana routes
to an external facilitator, which pins the sponsor and would reject the challenge
at `/verify`.

| Situation                                   | Behaviour                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Sponsor below floor, in-house facilitator   | Solana accepts are advertised in self-pay mode (no `feePayer`); the endpoint stays payable on Solana.          |
| Sponsor below floor, external facilitator   | The Solana accept is not advertised. Other configured networks still are.                                     |
| No network left to offer                    | `503 settlement_unavailable`, retryable, never the `500 no_payto_configured` misconfiguration error.           |
| Sponsored payment lands while the wallet is short | `503 settlement_unavailable` (`fee_wallet_below_floor`, `fee_wallet_cannot_cover_settle`). Only a genuinely unexplained settle failure is `502 settle_failed`. |
| Self-pay buyer cannot cover the network fee | `402 insufficient_fee_balance` (`buyer_cannot_cover_fee`): add a little SOL and pay again. No top-up of ours helps. |

**Buyers should treat `503 settlement_unavailable` as retry-after**, the same as
any capacity signal. No signed payment is consumed by a doomed settle, and
sponsored mode reappears automatically within about a minute of the wallet being
refunded (each instance re-reads the balance at most once per 20s).

Operators: the funding root tops the fee wallet back up automatically
(`/api/cron/treasury-topup`). Because the master funding wallet *is* the sponsor
wallet in the default deployment, the sweep reserves the settle floor plus
`ECONOMY_MASTER_SPONSOR_HEADROOM_SOL` (0.03) on top of its own reserve, so
funding engines can never starve settlement. Check the effective value in the
cron's `sweepFloorSol` field. When the master is thin, settle-critical fee wallets
are funded before float wallets regardless of which has the larger deficit, and a
skip reason distinguishes a dry master from a run cap that genuinely bound.

## Where payments land

Most endpoints pay the **platform receiver** (`X402_PAY_TO_SOLANA` /
`X402_PAY_TO_BASE` / `X402_PAY_TO_BSC`). Money reaches a third party by one of two
distinct mechanisms — don't conflate them:

**1. `payTo` override** — the 402 challenge names a different receiver, so the
buyer's USDC settles **directly** to that wallet and the platform never holds it:

| Endpoint | Receiver | Source |
| -------- | -------- | ------ |
| `/api/x402/skill-call` | skill **author** | `author_payto_*` ([skill-call.js:205](../api/x402/skill-call.js#L205)) |
| `/api/x402/service` | service **provider** | `row.payout_address` ([service.js:91](../api/x402/service.js#L91)) |
| `/api/x402/agents/:id` | the **agent** sold as an API | Solana payout wallet, else the agent's own Solana wallet (`resolveServicePayTo` in [agent-api-service.js](../api/_lib/agent-api-service.js)) |
| `/api/x402/asset-download` | 3D-asset **creator** | `creator_payto_*` ([asset-download.js:124](../api/x402/asset-download.js#L124)) |
| `/api/x402/animation-download` | clip **creator** | `creator_payto_*` ([animation-download.js:115](../api/x402/animation-download.js#L115)) |
| `/api/x402/pay-by-name` | **buyer-named** wallet | resolved name/`.sol`/address, direct SPL transfer ([pay-by-name.js:280](../api/x402/pay-by-name.js#L280)) |

**2. Post-settlement split** — the USDC lands in the **platform receiver**, then a
*separate* treasury forwards a share out-of-band (these are NOT `payTo` overrides):

| Endpoint | Lands in | Then forwarded to | By |
| -------- | -------- | ----------------- | -- |
| `/api/x402/cosmetic-purchase` | platform receiver | **creator** 50% (≤90% cap) | `COSMETIC_SPLIT_TREASURY_SECRET_KEY_B64` ([cosmetics-economy.js:203](../api/_lib/cosmetics-economy.js#L203); the 50% default and 90% ceiling are [L31-L32](../api/_lib/cosmetics-economy.js#L31)) |
| `/api/x402/dance-tip` | platform receiver | **dancer** (full tip) | `club-payouts` cron ([club/sweep.js](../api/_lib/club/sweep.js)) paying from `CLUB_SOLANA_TREASURY_SECRET_KEY_B64` ([club/payouts.js:55](../api/_lib/club/payouts.js#L55)) |
| `/api/x402/club-cover` | platform receiver (kept) | — (funds the club float; issues a door pass) | — |

`/api/x402/ring-settle` is an **internal** primitive (`discoverable:false`) — it is
deliberately not advertised in the 402 challenge or the discovery catalog; it
recirculates funds back to `X402_PAY_TO_SOLANA` to keep the closed loop balanced
([ring-settle.js:18](../api/x402/ring-settle.js#L18)). The full wallet-by-wallet
picture — every receiver, tip, split, treasury, and fee rate — is in the
[money map](money-map.md).

## Intel & oracle endpoints

These return market/polling information and are the ones the autonomous loop pays
for to feed the oracle and sniper.

| Endpoint                        | Default    | Returns                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/api/x402/token-intel`         | $0.01      | Live market intel for any token (price, 24h change, market cap, liquidity, volume, signal). |
| `/api/x402/crypto-intel`        | $0.01      | Agent-readable crypto market signal (bullish/bearish/neutral) + rationale.                  |
| `/api/x402/three-intel`         | $0.01      | Intel focused on $THREE.                                                                    |
| `/api/x402/fact-check`          | $0.10      | Claim fact-check with cited sources, authority weights, and a SHA-256 attestation. A free daily quota per IP runs first; over-quota checks pay the x402 price. |
| `/api/x402/symbol-availability` | $0.001     | Whether a ticker symbol is taken; `-batch` variant $0.005.                                  |
| `/api/x402/bazaar-feed`         | $0.001     | x402 bazaar service listings feed.                                                          |

## Market intelligence endpoints

Agent-ready answers composed over live market data — composites, verdicts, and
risk flags rather than raw category feeds (the raw feeds stay free at
`/api/defi/*`, `/api/coin/*`, and `/api/news/*`; these paid surfaces are the
loss-leader funnel's paid tier). Every one refuses before settlement when it has
no data to sell, so a buyer is never charged for missing data. The
DeFiLlama-backed boards (`defi-radar`, `yield-scan`, `stablecoin-health`,
`hack-check`) and `market-mood` keep a shared last-good copy
(`cacheWrapLastGood` in `api/_lib/cache.js`) for 15 minutes past their normal
TTL: a short upstream blip serves that recent copy rather than a refusal, and the
pre-settle `503` fires only when there has never been data to serve. Their
upstream reads go through `api/_lib/upstream-fetch.js` (bounded timeout, one
retry), and `three-intel` reads $THREE's market through the shared failover
reader (`api/_lib/market/token-market.js`: Birdeye, tokens.xyz, DexScreener,
GeckoTerminal, DefiLlama, Raydium) instead of a single DexScreener call.

| Endpoint                        | Default | Returns                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `/api/x402/defi-radar`          | $0.005  | One-call DeFi composite: total TVL, 24 h TVL gainers/losers, top fee earners, top DEX volumes.   |

| `/api/x402/market-heatmap`      | $0.002  | Top coins with 1 h/24 h/7 d momentum + breadth stats (CoinGecko→CoinPaprika failover).          |
| `/api/x402/gas-oracle`          | $0.001  | Live fee tiers for Ethereum + Base (real `eth_feeHistory`) and Solana priority-fee percentiles.  |
| `/api/x402/market-mood`         | $0.002  | Fear & Greed × 192-feed news sentiment composite (0–100) with divergence flag + driver headlines. |

| `/api/x402/robinhood-portfolio` | $0.002  | Multiplier-correct Stock Token portfolio for a Robinhood Chain wallet: each symbol's true position (balance x ERC-8056 uiMultiplier) at on-chain Chainlink NAV, plus total USD value. |

There is also a registry-derived `market-*` family — one endpoint per raw data
category, projected from `api/_lib/market-data/registry.js`. Each is $0.001
USDC per call unless noted, and every one has a free counterpart at the path
named in its description:

| Endpoint                        | Default | Returns                                                                                          |

Settles into a real job with safety screening, tracked shipping and an on-chain certificate. |

Beneath the named endpoints sits the **datapoint fabric**: `/api/x402/d/<family>/…`
(one route, `api/x402/d/[...path].js`) serves 1,000,000+ individually priced
datapoints at **$0.0005** USDC each by default, overridable per family with
`X402_PRICE_DATAPOINT_<FAMILY>`. See [Market data API](market-data-api.md#the-datapoint-fabric--1000000-standalone-endpoints).

## Agent & reputation endpoints

| Endpoint                            | Default   | Returns                                    |

| `/api/x402/agents/:id`              | per agent | One turn with a whole agent its owner sells as an API: `POST { message, history? }` returns `{ reply, model, usage }`. The owner sets the price; `GET /api/x402/agents` lists every agent on sale. See [Sell your agent as an API](x402.md#sell-your-agent-as-an-api). |
| `/api/x402/pump-agent-audit`        | $0.02     | Audit of a pump agent's behavior/holdings. |

## Generation & 3D endpoints

| Endpoint                                                    | Default   | Returns                                                                                      |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/api/x402/forge`                                           | tiered    | Text/image → 3D model (price by tier; GPU-bound). Every settled generation also lands in the public community gallery (`forge_creations`) stamped with the payer, settle signature, and price; the gallery shows a Solscan-linked "x402" provenance badge. See [Avatar pipeline](avatar-pipeline.md). |
| `/api/x402/embody`                                          | $1.00     | **Embodiment.** One call, an agent buys itself a body: prompt or image in → rigged, voiced 3D avatar out, plus a durable persona id and a one-tag `<iframe>` embed for any website. Settles on delivery — a failed generation never charges. See [Embodiment](embody.md). |
| `/api/x402/pipeline`                                        | per stage | **One call, full 3D asset pipeline**: text or GLB in, rigged/optimized game-ready GLB out. Ordered chain of `generate → rig → remesh → gameready → stylize`; the 402 quote is the exact sum of the requested stages. Poll free at `/api/forge?job=<id>` for per-stage progress. A bare POST with no body (how listing validators probe a paid row) gets the 402 priced at the catalog's example chain; the body validation error is raised only for a caller that pays. See [3D pipeline](3d-pipeline.md). |
| `/api/x402/pipeline-rig`                                    | $0.05     | **Pipeline — Rig.** Static GLB in → animation-ready rigged GLB out (skeleton + skin weights). One paid call, durable URL. See [3D pipeline](3d-pipeline.md). |
| `/api/x402/pipeline-remesh`                                 | $0.03     | **Pipeline — Remesh.** Retopologize a GLB (triangle/quad/lowpoly, repair, decimate to a face budget) with texture re-baked. GLB in → GLB out. See [3D pipeline](3d-pipeline.md). |

| `/api/x402/pipeline-stylize`                                | $0.03     | **Pipeline — Stylize.** Geometric restyle (voxel/brick/voronoi/lowpoly) that rebuilds the mesh. GLB in → GLB out. See [3D pipeline](3d-pipeline.md). |
| `/api/x402/pipeline-rembg`                                  | $0.01     | **Pipeline: Background Removal.** Image in → transparent PNG out (clean reference view for image→3D). `model`: `rmbg2` (default), `birefnet` (cleanest hair and thin edges, ~6 s), `u2net_human_seg`, `isnet`, `u2net`, `silueta`. See [3D pipeline](3d-pipeline.md). |
| `/api/x402/mint-to-mesh`, `/api/x402/mint-to-mesh-batch`    | $0.001    | Token/mint → 3D mesh; `mint-to-mesh-batch` runs a set at $0.05.                              |
| `/api/x402/model-check`, `/api/x402/model-validation-sweep` | $0.001    | Validate a GLB / sweep a batch. (`model-check` is kept as a paid convenience; the same inspection is free at `/api/3d/inspect`.) |
| `/api/x402/avatar-optimize-batch`                           | $0.001    | Batch optimization pass over the top N avatars.                                              |

No SOL, no wallet, no account: the server fronts the deploy cost and signs the create tx; you pay USDC. Optional vanity mint. Full flow + funnel in [pump-launcher.md](pump-launcher.md). |
| [`/api/x402/vanity`](vanity.md)                                                                                                                                           | $0.01–$0.50 (≤3) · $2.50–$10 (4–5, inventory-only) | **Vanity Grinder** — get a brand-new Solana address that starts with your ticker/prefix and/or ends with a suffix, for a branded token mint or agent/treasury wallet. Checks the pre-ground warehouse first for **instant delivery** (`source: "inventory"`); falls back to a live grind (`source: "ground"`) up to 3 chars. Keypair or importable BIP-39 mnemonic; nothing stored; optional `sealTo` ECIES. Full doc: [vanity.md](vanity.md). |
| [`/api/x402/vanity-verifiable`](vanity.md#tier-2--provably-fair-grinder)                                                                                                  | $0.02–$0.40    | **Provably-fair grinder** — same grind with a signed commit–reveal receipt proving the key was ground fresh and never kept. Spec: [PROTOCOL-vanity.md](PROTOCOL-vanity.md). |
| [`/api/x402/vanity-premium`](vanity.md#tier-3--premium-inventory)                                                                                                         | $1–$50 by rarity | **Premium inventory** — buy a pre-ground 4–5+ char brandable address from stock. GET lists available patterns + prices (free); `?address=…` buys via x402 and delivers the key **once** (ciphertext destroyed on delivery). Browsable at `/vanity/premium`. |
| `/api/x402/pay-by-name`                                                                                                                                                   | $0.001         | Resolve and pay a `@username` / `.sol` name / raw address (see [Agent wallets](agent-wallets.md)); the paid resolve toll is $0.001, the transfer amount itself is buyer-specified. A name that resolves to nothing returns `404 not_found` and the payment is left unsettled, so an unresolvable name is free. A body-less POST lands on this paid resolve lane and gets the 402 challenge (the free prep flow must say `mode: "prep"` or carry its wallet/amount fields). |
| `/api/x402/did`                                                                                                                                                           | $0.001         | **POST** is the DID verification canary: it resolves three.ws's published W3C DID document over its real public route, structurally validates it, and returns `{ verified, latency_ms, configured, checks }`. `configured: false` means the resolver answered 404 or could not be reached at all. `mode: "sweep"` audits recent agent identities for resolvable key material instead. **GET** is the free publisher for `/.well-known/did.json`; every other verb returns `405`. |
| `/api/x402/three-buy`                                                                                                                                                     | $0.001         | Micro-buy service: one settled toll payment triggers one small, real on-chain USDC to $THREE buy funded by the micro-buy wallet (driven by the `three-buy-loop` cron). |
| `/api/x402/knock`                                                                                                                                                         | set by recipient | **Knock**: pay a person's own price and get exactly one message through to them, in person. The recipient sets what a moment of their attention costs and the USDC settles straight to their wallet, never the platform's, so a priced door cannot be opened without one. The accepted message becomes a companion event whose importance is derived from the amount paid, and their 3D companion walks on screen wherever they are and delivers it out loud. Body is validated against that door's limits before any 402 is issued, so nobody pays for a message that was going to be refused. |
| `/api/x402/billboard`                                                                                                                                                     | $0.05          | Post to the on-platform billboard.                                                                                          |

| `/api/x402/cosmetic-purchase`                                                                                                                                             | per item       | Buy a cosmetic; the price comes from the catalog rarity, never the client. Ownership is recorded to the `account` query param. A wallet that already paid re-confirms for free with SIWX, but only for itself or for an account that already owns the item, so one purchase can never unlock the cosmetic on a third account. |

## Observability, revenue & ops endpoints

Several endpoints in `api/x402/` report on the platform itself. The paid ones
charge a token fee (they are real, sellable observability products an agent can
consume); a few are **free** read surfaces that happen to live in the same
directory.

| Endpoint                           | Default  | Returns                                                                                                                                                           |

| `/api/x402/analytics`              | $0.005   | Platform reports: club and listing analytics. The volume report's gross totals include the internal ring, so it carries a `revenue_split` block (external / internal ring / synthetic, or `null` when it cannot be computed). |
| `/api/x402/mcp-tool-catalog`       | $0.001   | Snapshot of every MCP tool (name, paid/free, price, input shape) and a diff vs the last snapshot (added / removed / re-priced tools).                           |

## $THREE only

Any endpoint that references a coin references **$THREE**
(`FeMbDoX7R1Psc4GEcvJdsbNbZA3bfztcyDCatJVJpump`). Endpoints that accept an
arbitrary token (e.g. `token-intel`, `mint-to-mesh`) take the mint as runtime
input and do not promote any specific token.
