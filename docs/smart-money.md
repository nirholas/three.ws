# Smart Money Radar: follow the wallets that actually win

Smart Money Radar is a live, first-party reputation graph of every pump.fun wallet. It crosses each coin's buyers with which coins actually graduated, folds the result into a per-wallet track record, and surfaces two things you cannot get from a price chart: which wallets keep picking winners, and what that proven money is buying right now. Every number is earned from on-chain outcomes, not a hand-curated allowlist.

Page: [/smart-money](https://three.ws/smart-money)

API: `/api/pump/smart-money` (feed, leaderboard, per-coin, per-wallet). The coin drawer also reads `/api/oracle/coin` for conviction context.

## Why it exists

The single most predictive early signal on pump.fun is not the chart, it is who is buying. A wallet that has repeatedly entered coins that went on to graduate is worth watching; a wallet that dumps every launch it touches is worth avoiding. That information exists on chain, but nobody keeps a running scorecard in time. Smart Money Radar is that scorecard. It re-earns every wallet's reputation continuously from real outcomes, so a coin's "pedigree" is the buy-weighted track record of the wallets actually in it, and a wallet's rank is its own history of picking coins that graduated. This is the same proven-wallet ledger the WHO pillar of [Oracle](./oracle.md) draws on, exposed as its own browsable surface.

## How it works

The page is a self-contained module inside `pages/smart-money.html` that polls `/api/pump/smart-money` every 20 seconds (paused when the tab is hidden). It has three tabs: **Smart money is buying** (the coin feed), **Top wallets** (the leaderboard), and **Watchlist** (a local list of up to 200 mints in `localStorage`).

The numbers are produced by a cron rollup (`api/cron/smart-money-rollup.js`) in three phases that write to `wallet_reputation`, `coin_smart_money`, and a `smart_money_scored` dedupe ledger:

**Phase A: judge and fold.** Six hours after launch, a coin's outcome is binary: present in `pumpfun_graduations` is a win, otherwise a dud. Each run judges up to 400 coins, oldest first; the budget has to outrun the firehose (about 32k mints a day), because a coin that ages past the 14-day retention window unjudged is pruned and its buyers never fold into anyone's record. For the top 60 buyers of each judged coin, per-wallet deltas are folded into `wallet_reputation`. An entry counts as **early** when the wallet's first buy is within 180 seconds of the coin's first trade, and a **dump** when the wallet sold at least half of what it bought.

**Phase B: recompute reputation.** For each touched wallet the score is:

```
win_rate       = round(wins / (wins + duds) * 100, 1)        # percent, 0-100
early_win_rate = round(early_wins / early_entries * 100, 1)  # percent, 0-100
dump_rate      = round(dumps / (wins + duds) * 100, 1)       # percent, 0-100
confidence     = clamp(judged / 12, 0, 1)          # full confidence at 12 judged coins
earlyBonus     = clamp((early_win_rate - win_rate) * 0.4, 0, 20)
dumpPenalty    = dump_rate * 0.4
smart_money_score = round(clamp(win_rate + earlyBonus - dumpPenalty, 0, 100) * confidence, 1)
```

The label follows from the profile, evaluated in this order: a creator with 3 or more launches, zero graduations, and at least 3 coins traded is a `rugger`; fewer than 4 judged coins is `fresh`; a dump rate of 60 percent or more is a `dumper`; a score of 70 or more is `smart_money`; so is a sustained edge over a real sample, 8 or more judged coins at a 35 percent or better win rate (the pump.fun base rate is around 12 percent, so that is roughly a 3x edge); 5 or more early entries with a win rate under 25 percent is a `sniper`; everything else is `neutral`.

**Phase C: score live coins.** For every coin launched in the last 3 hours, `coin_smart_money` is computed from its non-creator buyers (creators do not lend pedigree to their own coin):

```
weightedAvg  = sum(reputation * buy) / sum(buy)     # unknown wallets score 0, dragging it down
networkBonus = min(smart_wallet_count, 5) * 4        # capped at +20
smart_money_score = round(clamp(weightedAvg + networkBonus, 0, 100), 1)
```

A wallet is "proven smart money" at reputation 70 or more. The card's smart-money **share** is proven buy volume over total buy volume. The top 8 wallets by score become the coin's `notable` roster, each re-resolved to its live label so the display never goes stale.

## Walkthrough

1. Open [/smart-money](https://three.ws/smart-money). The hero shows live totals: proven wallets, proven win rate, tracked capital, coins on radar, and last-updated.
2. Stay on **Smart money is buying**. Filter by `On radar (fresh)`, `Graduated`, or `All`, and sort by pedigree, smart-money share, smart buy volume, proven wallets in, or freshest. Each card shows the pedigree badge, the share bar, and up to four notable wallet labels.
3. Click a coin to open its drawer: the full notable roster, and an Oracle conviction slot fetched separately from `/api/oracle/coin`.
4. **[Fork this trade](fork-trade.md)** on the card or in the drawer. It opens the real pump.fun trade panel for that coin, quoted live and screened by the safety firewall, and your own browser wallet signs it. Nothing is delegated and no balance is held. The drawer's **Share** button hands you a one-tap fork link (carrying your referral code when you are signed in) so the wallets you found can travel.
5. Switch to **Top wallets**. Filter by label (`smart_money`, `sniper`, `dumper`, or all), or paste a wallet address to jump straight to it. The sortable table shows win rate, early-win rate, dump rate, record, volume, and score.
6. Click any wallet to see its recent coins and cross-navigate back to a coin it bought. Star coins to your Watchlist to track them locally.

## Examples

Every read is public and IP rate-limited (600 requests per minute per IP).

```bash
# The live feed: coins ranked by smart-money score, graduated ones included
curl 'https://three.ws/api/pump/smart-money?limit=100&graduated=1'

# The wallet leaderboard: proven wallets with at least 4 judged coins
curl 'https://three.ws/api/pump/smart-money?leaderboard=1&limit=100&min_coins=4'

# One coin's pedigree and notable roster
curl 'https://three.ws/api/pump/smart-money?mint=<MINT>'

# One wallet's track record and recent coins
curl 'https://three.ws/api/pump/smart-money?wallet=<WALLET>'
```

```javascript
// Find the freshest coins where proven money already has real skin in
const { coins } = await fetch(
  'https://three.ws/api/pump/smart-money?limit=100&graduated=0'
).then((r) => r.json());

const conviction = coins
  .filter((c) => c.smart_wallet_count >= 2)
  .sort((a, b) => b.smart_money_score - a.smart_money_score);

for (const c of conviction.slice(0, 5)) {
  console.log(c.symbol, 'pedigree', c.smart_money_score, 'proven wallets', c.smart_wallet_count);
}
```

## States and limits

- **Auth.** The read APIs are public and require no account. The rollup cron is Bearer-authenticated with `CRON_SECRET`.
- **Rate limit.** 600 requests per minute per IP; over that returns 429.
- **Warm-up window.** A coin is not judged until roughly 6 hours after launch, so a very fresh coin shows "not scored yet." The per-coin read deliberately returns `200 { found: false }` rather than a 404 for an unscored mint.
- **Input validation.** A `wallet` or `mint` that is not a base58 Solana address is refused at the boundary with `400 invalid_wallet` / `400 invalid_mint`, so "that is not an address" and "no track record yet" stay different answers. Every error on the route, the wallet 404 included, carries the shared `{ error, error_description }` shape.
- **Empty and error states.** The feed, leaderboard, and watchlist each have designed empty copy ("No proven money on a fresh coin yet," "No wallets ranked yet"). A wallet with no history returns 404 and renders "No track record yet." A failed full refresh shows a stale-data reconnecting bar with a Retry button and escalates its message after repeated failures. The watchlist tells a network failure apart from an honest "not on the radar": when every lookup fails to reach the API (or answers 5xx), the grid shows one "Couldn't reach the radar" panel with a Retry and keeps the saved list, and a single unreachable coin gets a "Couldn't load this one" card rather than being labelled unscored.
- **Deep links.** `/smart-money?wallet=<address>` and `/smart-money?mint=<address>` open that drawer on load, so an address cited on another surface (the [Fade Radar](./fade-radar.md) board, a shared link) lands on its record instead of an unfiltered board. A malformed address is ignored rather than opening an empty drawer.
- **Two engines, one name.** This page reads `/api/pump/smart-money` (the graduation-outcome rollup). A sibling endpoint, `/api/intel/smart-money`, is a distinct funder-cluster and sybil-detection graph used by other surfaces. They answer related questions from different tables; do not conflate them.
