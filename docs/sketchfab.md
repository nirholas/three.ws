# Sketchfab showcase

The best community-made forge models are published to the official three.ws
account on [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com), the largest public 3D model
site. Each model page there links back to the creation on three.ws, so the
showcase doubles as a discovery channel: someone browsing Sketchfab finds a
model, follows the link, and can remix it or forge their own.

This is a curated feed, not a mirror. Only models the community has already
validated get pushed, a few per week.

## What gets picked

Selection runs three times a week (Mon/Wed/Fri) and takes up to
`SKETCHFAB_UPLOADS_PER_RUN` models per run (default 2), in this order:

1. **Weekly Forge-Off winners.** The creation crowned by community vote each
   week on the [forge board](/forge) is the strongest curation signal on the
   platform and always goes first.
2. **Top-voted board models.** Anything with at least one community upvote,
   highest votes first.
3. **Creator-validated models.** Creations whose maker explicitly accepted
   the result or downloaded the GLB, newest first. This tier keeps the
   showcase alive while board voting ramps up. Raw unreviewed output is
   never pushed.

A model is skipped when its GLB exceeds the Sketchfab upload cap (45 MB
guard), when it was already uploaded, or when it failed three times.

**Brand safety.** The official account never publishes firearms or explicit
content, regardless of what the forge itself allows. A conservative
word-boundary denylist filters the selection query and re-checks before
upload, and the NemoGuard content classifier in `api/_lib/publish-safety.js`
runs as a second, fail-open layer. Both are limits on what this account
publishes, not on what users may forge. Blocked creations are parked in the ledger (`blocked`) and never
re-picked. Refinement children are also excluded from the creator-validated
tier, since their prompts are instructions, not titles.

## What an upload looks like

Every published model carries:

- **The generation prompt** at the top of the description, in quotes. The
  model's name is the prompt with a leading article stripped and clamped to
  Sketchfab's display limit; a creation whose stored prompt is a placeholder
  rather than a description (the image-to-3D path stores its route name,
  `image-to-3d`, as the prompt) is named from its forge category instead
  ("Forged Sci-Fi"), falling back to "3D Model" for the catch-all buckets, so
  a winning image-derived model never reaches the account titled after a
  route.
- **AI disclosure**: Sketchfab's "Created With AI" tag (slug `createdwithai`),
  which its [AI-generated content policy](https://help.sketchfab.com/en/articles/16152133)
  requires on AI-generated models, plus a plain statement that the model was
  AI-generated on the three.ws Forge. Without the tag Sketchfab can file the
  model as "Human Created" in its search filters.
- **Backlinks with UTM parameters** (`utm_source=sketchfab`,
  `utm_medium=referral`, `utm_campaign=showcase`): one to the creation's
  [share page](/docs/share-and-embed) (`/forge/share/<id>`), one to
  [/forge](/forge). The UTM tags make Sketchfab referrals measurable in
  analytics, which decides whether the cadence goes up or down.
- **Tags**: `createdwithai`, `ai-generated`, `generative-ai`, `text-to-3d`, `threews`, plus the
  model's category.

Models are published viewable and inspectable but not downloadable: creations
belong to their creators, and the showcase does not relicense them.

## How it runs

`GET /api/cron/sketchfab-showcase` (Cloud Scheduler, `Bearer $CRON_SECRET`):

1. Refreshes the async processing status of recent uploads
   (`uploaded` becomes `live` when Sketchfab finishes processing).
2. Selects candidates and claims each in the `sketchfab_uploads` ledger
   before any network call, so a retried or concurrent run can never
   double-upload.
3. Downloads the stored GLB and posts it to the
   [Sketchfab Data API v3](https://docs.sketchfab.com/data-api/v3/index.html)
   (`POST /v3/models`, multipart).

`?dry_run=1` returns the current selection without uploading anything.

## Configuration

| Env var | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `SKETCHFAB_API_TOKEN` | Data API token of the official account (Sketchfab settings, Password & API). Unset: the cron is dormant and skips cleanly. |
| `SKETCHFAB_UPLOADS_PER_RUN` | Models per run, default 2, clamped 1-5. At the Mon/Wed/Fri schedule the default publishes up to 6 models a week. |

State lives in the `sketchfab_uploads` table (one row per creation:
`pending`, `uploaded`, `live`, `failed` with the error recorded, or `blocked`
when the brand-safety gate parked it). Code:
[`api/cron/sketchfab-showcase.js`](https://github.com/nirholas/three.ws/blob/main/api/cron/sketchfab-showcase.js)
and [`api/_lib/sketchfab.js`](https://github.com/nirholas/three.ws/blob/main/api/_lib/sketchfab.js).
