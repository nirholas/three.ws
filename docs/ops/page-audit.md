# Page audit: authed full-site console sweep

`scripts/page-audit.mjs` drives a real Chromium across every public page (from
`data/pages.json`, skipping the machine-readable section and any non-HTML
path) plus the authenticated dashboard/profile routes and live-seeded dynamic
agent routes. It runs each route in a desktop (1440x900) and a mobile
(iPhone 13) viewport and records what a human would otherwise hunt for with
the dev console open:

- `console.error` / `console.warn` output
- uncaught exceptions (`pageerror`)
- failed network requests (`requestfailed`)
- HTTP responses with status >= 400 (a 402 from an `/api/` path is recorded
  as info-severity `payment-gated`, since x402 endpoints correctly answer 402
  to a non-paying browser)
- horizontal overflow and elements escaping the viewport
- interactive controls below the 32px tap-target floor (mobile pass only)
- accessibility smells: missing `<title>`, missing image alt text, dead links

The sweep is read-only. It never mutates the target.

Console output from the headless box's software GL stack (ANGLE over
SwiftShader) is filtered out: `GL Driver Message (OpenGL, Performance, …)`
advisories such as "GPU stall due to ReadPixels" come from the emulated driver
rather than page code, and no visitor on a real GPU sees them. The filter is
scoped to the Performance category, so a driver message in the Error category
is still reported.

## Commands

```sh
# One-time: provision the QA account if AUDIT_EMAIL / AUDIT_PASSWORD are absent
npm run audit:web:provision

# One-time: create the auth session (server-set HttpOnly cookie -> storageState)
npm run audit:web:login

# Full sweep (picks up the saved session automatically)
npm run audit:web
```

Useful direct invocations:

```sh
node scripts/page-audit.mjs / /agents /pay   # only these routes
node scripts/page-audit.mjs --desktop-only   # skip the mobile viewport
node scripts/page-audit.mjs --mobile-only    # skip the desktop viewport
node scripts/page-audit.mjs --concurrency 6  # parallel pages per viewport
node scripts/page-audit.mjs --strict         # exit 1 on any error-severity finding
node scripts/page-audit.mjs --reverify-cap 0 # skip the solo re-check pass
node scripts/page-audit.mjs --engine webkit   # audit in Safari's engine
```

## Engines: why Chromium alone is not enough

`--engine` picks the renderer: `chromium` (default), `webkit`, or `firefox`.

Chromium is the default because it is the only browser every machine here
already has. It cannot, on its own, see a class of bug that only Safari shows.
JavaScriptCore and V8 disagree about *when* a temporal dead zone is checked:
JavaScriptCore checks an assignment target before it evaluates the right-hand
side, V8 checks it afterwards. So a module that bootstraps itself above the
`let`s it writes renders perfectly in Chrome and throws
`Cannot access uninitialized variable.` in every Safari, desktop and iOS alike.

That is not hypothetical. It is how every `/avatars/:id` page shipped dead in
Safari while this audit, the production smoke sweep, and review all stayed
green. `npm run check:tdz-bootstrap` now refuses that ordering at build time
(it runs inside `build:gcp`), and a WebKit pass here catches the runtime half:

```sh
npx playwright install webkit        # one time
node scripts/page-audit.mjs --engine webkit --desktop-only --strict
```

Run a WebKit pass before any release that touched page-level JavaScript. It is
worth the extra minutes precisely because nothing else in the pipeline looks at
a non-V8 engine.

## Which routes get audited

`scripts/lib/audit-routes.mjs` is the one answer, shared with the visual sweep
(`scripts/page-snapshot.mjs`) so the two can never disagree about what pages
the site has. It draws from three sources:

1. **`data/pages.json`**, the public manifest that also drives `/sitemap`,
   `llms.txt` and the changelog. The machine-readable section and any non-HTML
   path are skipped: there is no DOM to audit.
2. **`AUTHED_ROUTES`**, the signed-in surfaces the public manifest deliberately
   omits. These are read out of the `vercel.json` route table rather than
   hand-listed: every concrete `/dashboard/*` entry that serves a page, plus
   `/profile`, `/settings` and `/my-agents`. Redirect stubs and regex patterns
   are excluded, since neither addresses a page with content in it.
3. **`seedDynamicRoutes()`**, parameterised routes (an agent id, a launch mint)
   filled with real ids read from the live API at run time.

The authed list is derived because the hand-kept copy of it went stale with no
signal at all. By 2026-09-04 ten of its eighteen entries had become 301 stubs
pointing at consolidated dashboard pages, so a third of every authenticated
sweep was spent loading empty redirects, while twenty-one live dashboard pages
had never once been audited under a session. The first sweep after the change
found real defects on two of the newly covered pages. Reading the route table
means a dashboard page that is added, renamed or consolidated is picked up by
the next sweep without anyone remembering to edit a second list.
`tests/audit-routes.test.js` pins that: a stub or a pattern in `AUTHED_ROUTES`,
or a served dashboard page missing from it, fails the suite.

## Targeting

`BASE_URL` selects the target and defaults to production:

```sh
BASE_URL=https://three.ws npm run audit:web        # default
BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000 npm run audit:web   # vite dev server
```

Local targets get an extra noise filter for failures that only exist because
serverless functions and CDNs are absent under a bare dev server.

## QA account

The authed sweep signs in as a real member, so it needs `AUDIT_EMAIL` and
`AUDIT_PASSWORD` in `.env`. If they are missing, `npm run audit:web:provision`
(`scripts/provision-audit-account.mjs`) creates a fresh account by driving the
real `/register` page in a headless Chromium: same form, same clickwrap
checkbox, same `POST /api/auth/register` the page makes. It then proves the new
credentials authenticate through `/api/auth/login` and writes them into `.env`
(mode 0600), leaving every other line in the file untouched.

```sh
npm run audit:web:provision                                  # against production
npm run audit:web:provision -- --username qa-audit-mine      # pick the username
npm run audit:web:provision -- --print-only                  # don't touch .env
BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000 npm run audit:web:provision   # against dev
```

The register form takes a username, not an email address, and the server
derives `<username>@users.three.ws.local` as the account email. That derived
address is what lands in `AUDIT_EMAIL`, because `/api/auth/login` treats any
value containing `@` as an email lookup. No server-side code reads these two
vars: they are a local-harness credential, so the Cloud Run service env does
not need them. `scripts/likeness-eval.mjs`,
`scripts/reconstruct-load-test.mjs` and `scripts/capture-bundles-media.mjs`
read the same pair.

## Session file

`--login` posts `AUDIT_EMAIL` / `AUDIT_PASSWORD` to `/api/auth/login` on the
chosen `BASE_URL` and saves cookies plus localStorage (including the
optimistic auth hint) to `.auth/audit-state.json`. The `.auth/` directory is
gitignored. Every later run replays that storageState; without it the audit
runs anonymously and skips the authenticated-only routes. Re-run
`npm run audit:web:login` when the session expires.

## Re-verification: every error is confirmed solo

The sweep loads `--concurrency` pages at once, and a WebGL-heavy page audited
alongside four others inside one headless browser fails in ways no real visitor
sees. Software GL contention makes texture uploads fail, and a contended page
misses a 25 s `networkidle` it would otherwise clear easily. On 2026-07-28 that
put 108 phantom `GLTFLoader: Couldn't load texture blob:…` errors plus a run of
nav timeouts into one report: 4 findings in 5 were noise, and the real defects
were buried under them.

So after the sweep, every route/viewport pair holding an error-severity finding
is audited again **on its own**, in a fresh context, with nothing else running:

- A finding that reproduces keeps `error` severity and is marked `reproduced`.
- A finding that does not reproduce is demoted to `info` and labelled
  `[not reproduced on a solo re-check: contention artifact]`. It is never
  deleted, so a genuinely intermittent bug is still visible in the report.
- Findings are matched across runs by a fingerprint that strips blob URLs,
  uuids, base58 addresses, query strings and bare numbers, so the same defect
  matches even though its ids differ every load.

The solo re-check also navigates with a wider budget than the sweep: 60 s
against the sweep's 25 s. The pass removes the contention *this run* creates,
but it cannot remove the load every other process on the box creates, and a
starved browser misses a 25 s navigation on a page that is perfectly healthy.
On 2026-09-08, with three sweeps and two Playwright suites sharing one machine,
`/dashboard/avatars` timed out at 25 s in the sweep and again in the re-check,
and was published as that run's only confirmed error; loaded by itself moments
later it reached `domcontentloaded` in 769 ms with nothing logged. Re-checking a
timeout with the budget that produced it only reproduces the starvation. A
genuinely dead route still fails at 60 s and stays an error, and the sweep's own
budget is unchanged, so a slow page is still caught by the first pass.

Errors that survive this pass reproduced on a page loaded by itself, which is
what makes the error count worth acting on. `--reverify-cap N` bounds how many
pairs get re-checked (default 60, `0` disables the pass); anything past the cap
is reported unverified and named as such.

The cap is spread evenly across viewports rather than spent in arrival order.
Desktop runs first, so a flat slice handed every slot to desktop: the full sweep
of 2026-08-11 re-checked 60 desktop pairs and published 28 mobile pages
unverified as the report's worst offenders, while the desktop pages beside them
demoted at four in five. Re-running those 28 one at a time confirmed all but two
were contention artifacts. If a run still reports pairs beyond the cap, raise
`--reverify-cap` or re-run just those routes with `--concurrency 1` before
acting on them.

## A crashed browser no longer costs you the run

A full sweep drives 700+ routes, most of them WebGL, through one browser
process for well over an hour, on a box that is usually running other agents'
builds beside it. That browser gets killed sometimes. Until 2026-09-03 the
sweep had no answer for it: the next `newContext` threw
`Target page, context or browser has been closed`, and the run died with every
already-collected finding still in memory and nothing written to `reports/`.
The run of 2026-09-03 lost 782 desktop routes plus 49 crawl-discovered ones
that way, at the very last step before the report.

The browser is now a session that relaunches when its process is gone, the
per-viewport context is rebuilt on demand, and a route that failed only because
its session was torn down is retried against the fresh one rather than reported
as an `audit-crash` against a page nobody ever loaded. If the solo re-check
cannot get a browser at all, it stops early and the report is still written,
carrying a line that says which errors went unverified. The one thing that
never happens now is finishing the sweep and having nothing to show for it.

You will see `⚠ browser process gone; relaunching (#n)` when it fires. A run
with many of those was fighting for memory: lower `--concurrency` before
trusting its error counts.

## Reports

Findings are deduped, grouped per route, scored by severity (error / warn /
info), and written to `reports/page-audit-<timestamp>.json` and `.md`, with a
summary printed to the console. The `reports/` directory is gitignored, so
sweep output never lands in commits. `--strict` makes the process exit
nonzero when any error-severity finding exists, for use as a gate.
