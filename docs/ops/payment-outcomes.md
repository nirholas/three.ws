# Payment-outcome board

`GET /api/ops/payment-outcomes` is the single read that answers "are payments
healthy right now, and if not, which stage is failing?". It exists because the
x402 griefing classes (verify-reject floods, settle failures, sponsor-fee
starvation) historically became visible only after they halted the economy;
the 2026-07-11 fable audit filed the gap and this board closes it.

Two ways to read it: the JSON endpoint below (`curl` + `jq`, or wired into ops
tooling), and **[/payment-outcomes](../../pages/payment-outcomes.html)**, the
internal page that renders the same response. Neither is a summary of the
other: the page renders every panel this endpoint returns and adds no number of
its own.

## Auth

Same gate as `/api/ops/health`: an admin session, or `x-ops-secret` matching
`OPS_SECRET` (never `CRON_SECRET`; see `api/_lib/ops-auth.js`). Unset secret
means open in dev and denied in production. Read-only; it moves no funds and
never fires alerts (balance reads go through the ring monitor with alerting
disabled; the scheduled monitor owns paging).

Per-IP ceiling: the `authedReadIp` bucket (300 requests / 5 min), shared with
`/api/ops/health` and `/api/ops/money-health`. It is deliberately not the strict
`authIp` credential bucket, so polling a board cannot 429 an operator's login
from the same address. Over the ceiling the response is `429 rate_limited` with
a `retry-after` header.

## The response envelope

```json
{ "ok": true, "degraded": [], "generated_at": "…", "inbound": {…}, "ring_settle": {…}, "sponsor": {…}, "stranded_custody": {…} }
```

The panels are read independently, so one failing never blanks the others
(an RPC outage is exactly when the settle panels matter most). `ok` reports
whether the BOARD rendered, never whether payments are healthy: that verdict is
per panel. A panel that threw is replaced by `{ "error": "…" }`, named in
`degraded`, and the status code is `207 Multi-Status` instead of `200`, the same
convention `/api/ops/health` uses. Alert on `degraded` being non-empty: a board
that cannot see is not a board that is fine.

## The panels

### `inbound` (from `x402_audit_log`)

Counts and rates over 1h / 3h / 24h windows for payments arriving at our paid
routes:

- `settled` / `settle_failed`: outcomes of `settlePayment` after a valid
  verify. `settle_success_rate` = settled / (settled + settle_failed).
- `verify_rejected`: `verifyPayment` refusals, written durably as
  `payment_verify_rejected` events (metadata carries `reason` and
  `rejected_proof` vs `upstream_fault`). A spike here with flat settles is the
  junk-X-PAYMENT griefing signature: the per-IP verify penalty bucket should
  be absorbing it, and this is the panel that proves whether it is.
- `replay_rejected`, split by stage in `replay_stages_24h`: `pre_handler`
  means the durable spent-payment guard refused a replayed proof before the
  handler ran; `post_settle` means a lost insert race was refused at claim
  time. Any sustained nonzero rate is someone re-sending captured headers.
- `top_failure_reasons_24h` names the dominant failure codes with the stage
  (verify vs settle) so a 502 cluster is distinguishable from a rejected-proof
  wave without a log dive.
- `settled_volume_usd_24h` from settled `amount_atomics` (USDC, 6 decimals).
- `replay_reject_rate` has its own denominator, `inbound_attempts` (everything
  that arrived, replays included). Measuring replays against the verify
  denominator would report a rate above 1 during exactly the flood the number
  exists to detect, since replays are refused above verify. It is computed in
  the endpoint rather than in a renderer so the JSON, the page, and any ops
  script quote one number computed one way.

Replays are excluded from both rate denominators: they are refused before
verify and would otherwise dilute the signal.

### `ring_settle` (from `gatherX402SettleHealth`)

The outbound settle-success sensor over `x402_autonomous_log` (3h window,
rail-fault allowlist), verbatim: status, human detail, triage hint, and the
top fault signatures. This is the same object `/api/healthz` consumes; it is
included here so the board is complete without a second request. Its triage
map lives in [production-log-triage.md](production-log-triage.md).

The ring log is reason-blind for refusals that arrive over HTTP (they all read
as `http_5xx`), so the sensor reconciles status-only 5xx faults against the
facilitator's own book (`x402_self_facilitator_log.reject_reason`) for the same
window and names the dominant cause in `ring_settle.metrics.cause`:
`sponsor_floor` (the Solana accept was withdrawn under the SOL floor),
`fee_governor` (deliberate spend pacing, a budget problem, not a rail fault),
or `rail` (genuine settle faults). `governorSkips` is carried even on a healthy
rate so a wallet sliding toward its budget shows up before the rate does.

A rent-exemption failure on the fee payer (`InsufficientFundsForRent` on
account index 0, in either spelling the RPCs use) wears a rail-shaped reason
token (`sweep_broadcast_failed`, and `simulation_failed` on any path that has
not yet been split) while being the opposite of a rail fault: the transaction
never reached the rail because the sponsor could not pay for it. The verify
path stopped relying on that reconstruction on 2026-09-09 and now raises the
verdict as its own class, `sponsor_fee_unfunded` when the dry fee payer is our
sponsor and `payer_fee_unfunded` when it is the buyer's own wallet, so the
token alone carries the meaning. The sensor flags the remaining rail-shaped
rows from the full `error_msg` and counts both kinds as floor signals, not
faults, so a dry sponsor reads as
`cause: sponsor_floor` rather than pointing the operator at duplicate
signatures and RPC preflight (which is what happened for three hours on
2026-08-28). Because a sponsor under its floor is a hard stop, those attempts
also override the "too few attempts to judge" `unknown` verdict: once the
floor signals alone reach the minimum sample the status is `down` with a
`settle halted` detail, since under the floor nothing settles at all.

### `sponsor` (live RPC + `x402_self_facilitator_log`)

The fee wallet that pays every settle's SOL fee:

- `sol` is the live balance. Two different floors are reported and they are not
  interchangeable: `settle_floor_sol` is the facilitator's hard floor
  (`X402_SPONSOR_SOL_FLOOR_LAMPORTS`, default 0.02) where settlement is actually
  refused, and `sol_floor` is the ring monitor's watch floor at 1.5x that, which
  exists to warn early. `below_floor` compares against the watch floor.
- `burn_sol_per_day` is MEASURED from `fee_lamports` over successful settles,
  never quoted from memory: the folklore burn rate has been wrong by roughly 10x
  before (ISSUES.md item 6). It always ships with `burn_window_days` (the window
  it was measured over) and `settles_in_window` (the sample size). A burn rate
  without its window is a rumour, so nothing here prints one without the other.
- `runway_days` = balance / measured burn (to empty, what a funding ask is sized
  against). `runway_days_to_floor` = (balance minus the settle floor) / burn,
  which is the operational figure: settling stops at the floor, not at zero.
- `runway_status` is the verdict the alert fires on (see below), and the
  dashboard card colours from it so the board and the page cannot disagree.

### `stranded_custody` (custodial key health, snapshot-cached)

Custody the platform has LOST: wallets whose `encrypted_solana_secret` no longer
decrypts, so their SOL is visible on chain and can never be signed for. It sits
on this board because it is a payment-outcome fact: the treasury self-heal cannot
reclaim that SOL and the customers holding it cannot withdraw it. Before this
panel the only way to see the number was running
`scripts/audit-custodial-key-health.mjs` by hand, so weeks passed between
readings. The measurement itself is shared with that script
(`api/_lib/custodial-key-health.js`), so the CLI and the board cannot disagree.

- `status` is the verdict and `reason` says why:
  - `stranded` / `sealed`: funded wallets are sealed. `sol_stranded` and its
    `_platform` / `_customer` split are a real measurement.
  - `unknown` / `partial_read`: some sealed wallet never got a balance read (an
    RPC chunk failed), so the totals are a FLOOR, not a measurement. Re-read
    after the lane recovers rather than quoting the number.
  - `unknown` / `key_mismatch`: every wallet failed to decrypt. That is one wrong
    key for this deployment, essentially never a fleet of separately sealed
    wallets.
  - `unknown` / `no_decryption_key`: this process holds no custodial key at all
    (only possible outside production, where secret-box fails closed).
  - `clear`: nothing funded is sealed.
- Under either `unknown` key verdict the SOL fields are `null` rather than a
  number with a caveat attached. An unattributable total is exactly the phantom
  figure this surface exists to stop publishing.
- `brief` points at [stranded-wallets.md](stranded-wallets.md), the standing owner
  decision on the customer balances, whenever customer SOL is confirmed stranded.
- The panel is snapshot-cached for six hours per instance and concurrent reads
  share one scan (`cache_age_seconds` reports the snapshot's age). Custody loss is
  a rotation event, not a live metric, so polling the board never turns into a
  fleet-wide RPC sweep.

### The runway alert

The runway is no longer render-only. `checkRingWallets()` in
`api/_lib/x402/wallet-balance-monitor.js` runs on the autonomous loop's 10-minute
tick, measures the burn, and calls `sendOpsAlert` through the normal alerting path
(dashboard row always, Telegram push when `TELEGRAM_ALERTS_CHAT_ID` is wired).
The verdict logic and the alert copy are pure functions in
`api/_lib/x402/sponsor-runway.js`, unit-tested in
`tests/x402-sponsor-runway.test.js` (the arithmetic and the rendered string) and
`tests/x402-sponsor-runway-monitor.test.js` (that the monitor actually sends it).

| `runway_status` | Condition | Alerts |
|---|---|---|
| `critical` | balance at or under the settle floor | yes, `critical` |
| `warn` | `runway_days_to_floor` under the threshold | yes, `warn` |
| `ok` | runway at or above the threshold | no |
| `unknown` | balance unreadable, or no settles in the window | no |

`unknown` deliberately never pages. An idle rail has no measurable burn and
dividing by zero would page every quiet night, and an unreadable balance is an
RPC problem, not a funding one.

Two env knobs, both live without a redeploy:

| Var | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `X402_SPONSOR_RUNWAY_ALERT_DAYS` | `3` | days of runway to the floor below which the alert fires |
| `X402_SPONSOR_BURN_WINDOW_DAYS` | `7` | window the burn rate is measured over |

The alert message carries the wallet, the balance, the floor, the measured burn
with its window and sample size, both runway figures, the threshold, and a
top-up size computed from the measured burn. It points at the free self-heal
(`POST /api/cron/treasury-topup?dry=1`) before any funding ask, and it repeats
the rule that has broken the rail before: top up the SPONSOR or the economy
master, NEVER per-agent wallets (that strands SOL in wallets that pay no fees).

It also names the symptom in advance, because the symptom is misleading: under
the floor, `sponsorKnownBelowFloor()` makes `buildRequirements()` withdraw the
Solana accept from every 402 challenge, so the Solana-only ring never attempts a
payment and there is nothing to reject. Settlements collapse while rail faults
stay flat. The settle sensor reports that as `cause: sponsor_floor` (distinct
from `fee_governor` and `rail`) in `ring_settle.metrics`; the accepts are
checkable directly:

```sh
curl -s https://three.ws/api/x402/three-intel | jq '.accepts[].network'
# only eip155:8453 means the Solana accept has been withdrawn
```

## The page

`/payment-outcomes` ([pages/payment-outcomes.html](../../pages/payment-outcomes.html))
renders the whole response. It takes the same gate as the endpoint, is
`noindex, nofollow`, and is deliberately absent from `data/pages.json`: it is
internal tooling, like `/quality-bench` and `/likeness-bench`, not a public
surface.

- **The window selector (1h / 3h / 24h) is a re-render, not a request.** All
  three windows arrive in one response, so sweeping between them during an
  incident costs no extra database or RPC read. `Refresh` is the explicit
  refetch.
- **A rate with no attempts renders `n/a`, never `0%`.** A quiet rail and a
  totally failing rail must not look the same, so an empty window says so in
  words underneath.
- **A panel that failed renders its own error in place** and names the other
  panels as unaffected, matching the endpoint's 207 semantics. The banner at the
  top lists whatever is in `degraded`.
- **An unmeasured number is never a green zero.** The stranded-custody panel
  returns nulls when the process could not open the wallets at all, and the page
  renders `not measured` in muted type rather than a reassuring `0 SOL`.
- Panels: inbound rates for the selected window, top reject reasons and replay
  stages (both 24h), the outbound ring settle sensor with its triage hint, every
  configured ring wallet against its own floor plus the sponsor runway, and
  stranded custody.

## Reading it in an incident

1. `inbound.settle_success_rate` low but `verify_reject_rate` flat: the rail
   or facilitator is failing after verify. Check `ring_settle.detail` for the
   fault mix; `http_502` clusters with empty simulation logs are RPC/preflight
   faults (see [solana-rpc-lanes.md](solana-rpc-lanes.md)).
2. `verify_reject_rate` spiking: someone is flooding junk proofs. Confirm the
   verify penalty limiter is holding (the reasons list will be dominated by
   `verify_rejected` with `rejected_proof`).
3. Both fine but settles refused with 503s: look at `sponsor`. Floor breach or
   sub-day runway is the answer. Read `runway_status` first, then run the free
   self-heal (`POST /api/cron/treasury-topup?dry=1`, then without `?dry=1`)
   before asking for funds: reclaimable SOL sitting in platform agent wallets is
   often the answer, and every reclaim run now leaves `agent_reclaim` rows in
   `economy_master_ledger` saying whether it was `blocked` (an RPC or key
   problem, free to fix) or found `nothing_reclaimable` (the only case that
   genuinely needs the owner to send SOL).

   **Read `agent_reclaim.failed` in the dry plan before you trust its total.**
   The plan-only run opens each wallet's key exactly as the real run does, so a
   wallet whose secret does not decrypt is listed there at stage `recover` with
   reason `secret_undecryptable` instead of being counted as reclaimable. That
   SOL is real, visible on chain, and unreachable: it is encrypted under a key
   this deploy does not hold, and no cron run, RPC tier, or deposit moves it
   (see [wallet-key-migration.md](wallet-key-migration.md) for the recovery
   path, and put the retired key in `WALLET_ENCRYPTION_KEY_PREVIOUS` if you have
   it). Until 2026-09-02 the dry run skipped that check and reported those
   wallets as available on every tick, which sent two separate investigations
   away with "the cron will self-heal from here" when it could not. A dry total
   of 0 with a populated `failed` list means the same thing as
   `nothing_reclaimable`: the owner has to send SOL.
4. `replay_stages_24h` nonzero: captured X-PAYMENT headers are being re-sent;
   the guard is working if the settles panel is unaffected.
5. `stranded_custody.status` is `stranded`: capital is gone, not late. No cron
   run, RPC tier, or deposit reaches it. If `sol_stranded_customer` is above
   zero, that half is a support obligation and outranks every ops number on this
   board: read [stranded-wallets.md](stranded-wallets.md). A `key_mismatch`
   verdict is a deployment config problem instead, and the fix is the key, not
   the wallets.
