# Cron authentication: the two locks on `/api/cron/*`

The Cloud Scheduler jobs declared in `vercel.json` (its `crons` array is the
source of truth for how many) drive handlers that move real money: custody attestation, buybacks, treasury top-ups, payouts, wallet
intents, the dead-man switch. Anything that can invoke those can spend from
them, so the gate is layered and both layers fail closed.

## Lock 1: the handler gate (`api/_lib/cron-auth.js`)

Every file under `api/cron/` opens with `if (!requireCron(req, res)) return;`.
That helper is the only place the credential is compared:

- `CRON_SECRET` unset is a `503 not_configured`, never a pass. A misconfigured
  deploy must not expose a money-moving sweep.
- The comparison is constant time, so the secret has no timing oracle.
- `Authorization: Bearer <secret>` and `X-Cron-Secret: <secret>` are both
  accepted, and both carry the same secret. The second spelling is not
  historical clutter: it is what makes lock 2 attachable at all (see below).
- An inbound header like `x-vercel-cron` is never authorization on its own.

`tests/api/cron-auth-sweep.test.js` invokes every handler in the directory with
no credential on every test run and requires a closed status from each, plus
each of the `[name].js` dispatcher's routes individually. The sweep is
behavioral, not a grep, so a guard that exists but is never called still fails
it. It also runs against four deliberately broken fixtures (no guard, a verdict
computed and discarded, a 200 above the guard, a handler that hangs) and must
reject all four, so a sweep that quietly degraded into a no-op cannot pass.

## Lock 2: the edge gate (`server/cron-edge-auth.mjs`)

Lock 1 is a convention, not a mechanism. The server's filesystem phase routes
every `api/cron/*.js` file by its existence, so one future handler that forgets
the line is directly internet-invokable. The edge gate makes that omission
survivable: mounted ahead of the route table in `server/index.mjs`, it refuses
the request before any handler is imported.

It decides what counts as a cron path on the same view of the URL the API
dispatcher routes on (`apiSegments` in `server/route-resolve.mjs`): empty
segments dropped and each segment percent-decoded. Matching the raw string let
`/api//cron/x` and `/api/%63ron/x` slip past this gate while still dispatching
to `api/cron/x.js`; both are gated now, and a path that will not decode is
treated as gated rather than waved through.

It accepts two credentials, permanently. This is defense in depth, not a
migration with a cutover:

1. **`CRON_SECRET`**, via `isCronAuthorized()` from the same module lock 1 uses,
   so the edge and the handler can never disagree about what a valid secret is.
2. **A Cloud Scheduler OIDC identity token**: Google-signed, short-lived, bound
   to one audience, and unusable from a leaked env dump.

Both halves of the OIDC identity are required, and the email is the load-bearing
one: any Google service account can mint an ID token for an arbitrary audience,
so an audience match alone authenticates nobody. The token must carry
`email_verified: true`, an email in `CRON_OIDC_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`, and an audience
in `CRON_OIDC_AUDIENCE`. With either var unset the OIDC path is off and only the
secret is accepted.

| Var | Value to set | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `CRON_OIDC_AUDIENCE` | the Cloud Run service URL | audiences the edge will accept, comma-separated |
| `CRON_OIDC_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` | `three-ws@aerial-vehicle-466722-p5.iam.gserviceaccount.com` | service-account emails the edge will accept, comma-separated |

Neither var is set on `three-ws-api` today, so the OIDC path is currently off and
the edge accepts only `CRON_SECRET`; the live Cloud Scheduler jobs still
authenticate with `Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET`. The runbook below is the
step that turns the second credential on, and it has not been run yet.

The one case where the edge stands aside is "no credential configured at all"
(no `CRON_SECRET`, no OIDC pair), which is a developer's machine: the request
falls through so `requireCron` owns the single canonical 503. Production always
has `CRON_SECRET`, so production is always closed here. A fault inside the gate
itself is a 401, not a pass.

Covered by `tests/server-cron-edge-auth.test.js`, which verifies real RS256
signatures against a locally generated key set: a forged token, a wrong
audience, a wrong issuer, a wrong service account, an unverified email, and an
expired token are each refused, and a genuine one is accepted. It also pins the
path spellings above (doubled slashes, a percent-encoded `cron`) as gated.

## Attaching the OIDC token (the fleet-wide step)

**The trap:** Cloud Scheduler puts its OIDC token in the `Authorization` header.
The jobs today authenticate with `Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET`, so naively
adding `--oidc-service-account-email` DESTROYS the credential every job runs
on, and they 401 together. The secret must move to `X-Cron-Secret` in the same
update. `node scripts/create-gcp-scheduler.mjs --oidc` does exactly that, and
`tests/cron-scheduler-sync.test.js` pins the pairing so the two can never be
emitted apart.

Order matters. Attach the token first and require it second, never the reverse:

```sh
# 1. Teach the service which identity to trust (merge, never --set-env-vars).
gcloud run services update three-ws-api \
  --region us-central1 --project aerial-vehicle-466722-p5 \
  --update-env-vars \
CRON_OIDC_AUDIENCE=https://three-ws-api-lp642k3kpa-uc.a.run.app,\
CRON_OIDC_SERVICE_ACCOUNT=three-ws@aerial-vehicle-466722-p5.iam.gserviceaccount.com

# 2. Migrate ONE job and prove it before touching the fleet.
node scripts/create-gcp-scheduler.mjs --oidc --only uptime-check
gcloud scheduler jobs run cron--api-cron-uptime-check \
  --location us-central1 --project aerial-vehicle-466722-p5
gcloud scheduler jobs describe cron--api-cron-uptime-check \
  --location us-central1 --project aerial-vehicle-466722-p5 \
  --format='value(status.code,lastAttemptTime,state)'   # empty code = success

# 3. Migrate the rest.
node scripts/create-gcp-scheduler.mjs --oidc

# 4. Confirm nothing is failing, over a window that covers the slowest cron.
gcloud logging read \
  'resource.type="cloud_run_revision"
   resource.labels.service_name="three-ws-api"
   httpRequest.requestUrl:"/api/cron/"
   httpRequest.status=401' \
  --project aerial-vehicle-466722-p5 --freshness=2h --limit=20
```

The sync reads `CRON_SECRET` from `--env-file`, then `process.env`, then the
live Cloud Run service, so on an authenticated machine step 2 needs no argument.

Every deploy also runs `npm run deploy:gcp:sync-crons`
(`create-gcp-scheduler.mjs --missing-only`), which creates a job for each newly
declared cron and never touches an existing one. It does not pass `--oidc`, so
after the migration a cron added later starts on the Bearer secret, which the
edge still accepts. Re-run step 3 to move it onto the token.

**Rollback** is one command and needs nothing else: `node
scripts/create-gcp-scheduler.mjs` (no `--oidc`) puts the Bearer secret back on
every job. The edge keeps accepting it, because it never stopped.
