# three.ws production on Google Cloud — operations runbook

**This is the complete operational record of the production platform.** If the
machine that performed the migration is gone, this document + `gcloud` access
to the project is everything needed to operate, deploy, debug, and recover the
site. Written 2026-07-07, the day production moved off Vercel (Vercel disabled
the deployment with `402 DEPLOYMENT_DISABLED`; the site was dark until DNS
cutover to Google Cloud the same day).

Related: [server/README.md](../../server/README.md) (the server code itself),
[STRUCTURE.md](../../STRUCTURE.md) (surface map),
[docs/ops/gcp-model-workers.md](gcp-model-workers.md) (the 3D model workers,
which were already on Cloud Run before this migration).

## Architecture

```
Namecheap DNS (three.ws)
  A @   → 136.68.246.178      (global static IP: compute address "three-ws-ip")
  A www → 136.68.246.178
        │
Global External Application Load Balancer (EXTERNAL_MANAGED)
  :80  forwarding rule "three-ws-http"  → target-http-proxy  "three-ws-http-proxy"
        → url-map "three-ws-http-redirect" (301 → https)
  :443 forwarding rule "three-ws-https" → target-https-proxy "three-ws-https-proxy"
        → ssl-certificate "three-ws-cert" (Google-managed, three.ws + www.three.ws,
          auto-renews) → url-map "three-ws-lb"
        → backend-service "three-ws-backend" (Cloud CDN ON, cache mode
          USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS)
        → serverless NEG "three-ws-api-neg" (us-central1)
        │
Cloud Run service "three-ws-api" (us-central1, min 0, 2 vCPU / 2 Gi, timeout 900s,
allow-unauthenticated, runtime SA three-ws@…)
  └─ one Express container (server/index.mjs) serving:
       • static frontend from dist/ (baked into the image)
       • the vercel.json route table (1,285 rules as of 2026-09-01:
         headers/rewrites/redirects/404)
       • all api/** handlers with Vercel-parity filesystem routing
        │
Data layer (unchanged by the migration — all vendor-neutral HTTP):
  Neon Postgres (DATABASE_URL) · Upstash Redis · Cloudflare R2 (S3_* / R2_*)
Cloud Scheduler: one job per vercel.json cron (that array is the count) → GET /api/cron/* with
  `Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET`
```

- **GCP project:** `aerial-vehicle-466722-p5` (billing account "Sperax",
  `01B467-A61905-9A97D2` — the $100k credits pool; owner-confirmed 2026-07-07).
- **Region:** `us-central1` for everything (same as the model workers).
- **Image:** `us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/aerial-vehicle-466722-p5/cloud-run-source-deploy/three-ws-api:latest`
  Built from the repo-root [`Dockerfile`](../../Dockerfile). It runs as the
  unprivileged `node` user (not root) and prunes devDependencies after the SDK
  build (`npm prune --omit=dev`), so the runtime image carries only production
  deps. The container never writes to `/app` at runtime — the persona/ledger
  disk fallbacks and headless-chromium download both target `/tmp` — so the
  root-owned, read-only app tree is expected. Still single-stage: the
  `python3/make/g++` toolchain stays because `cloudbuild.yaml`'s inline-cache
  path (`BUILDKIT_INLINE_CACHE=1` + `--cache-from`) only restores the final
  stage's layers, so a multi-stage split would forfeit the cached `npm ci` and
  regress rebuilds from ~3 min to ~12 min. A future move to `docker buildx` with
  a registry cache would unlock the multi-stage drop of the toolchain.

### Production database (verified 2026-07-07)

The DB is **Neon Postgres, not hosted on Vercel** — the migration did not and
could not "move" it; Cloud Run connects to the same instance via `DATABASE_URL`.

- **Production DB:** Neon host `ep-muddy-morning-af1v1xpa-pooler.c-2.us-west-2.aws.neon.tech`
  — the live one, verified holding **344 tables / ~676k rows / 13.7k users /
  13.3k avatars**. This is the value `DATABASE_URL` carries on the Cloud Run
  service (and it was among the few vars the Vercel pull returned non-empty).
- **NOT production:** `ep-rapid-surf-ak9p7occ` (Neon project `wild-river-11025097`)
  appears in old env archives — it is a **stale/smaller copy** (85 tables /
  ~127k rows / 224 avatars). Do not point production at it.
- ⚠️ **DECOMMISSION HAZARD (confirmed 2026-07-08):** this Neon project was
  provisioned via Vercel's Postgres integration. If it's the **Vercel-Managed
  Integration** (billing inside Vercel), Neon's own docs state that deleting
  the database from Vercel's interface **removes the underlying Neon project
  permanently**, and Neon does **not** offer a self-serve transfer for
  Vercel-integrated projects ("projects with Vercel integrations cannot be
  transferred" — [neon.com/docs/manage/orgs-project-transfer](https://neon.com/docs/manage/orgs-project-transfer)).
  There is no dashboard "claim it" button — do not assume one exists.
  Two real paths before the Vercel account is closed:
  1. Open a Neon support ticket asking to detach/transfer `ep-muddy-morning`
     into a standalone (non-Vercel) Neon org — some users have gotten this
     handled manually by support even though it isn't self-serve.
  2. Cut over independently: provision a fresh standalone Postgres (Neon-native
     org or Cloud SQL), restore into it, swap `DATABASE_URL` on the Cloud Run
     service, verify, then let the old Vercel-linked project go.
  - **Safety net taken 2026-07-08:** full `pg_dump -Fc` of `neondb` (344
    tables, 673 MB live / 47 MB compressed) uploaded to Cloudflare R2 at
    `s3://chatty-storage/db-backups/neondb-2026-07-08.dump` — durable, off
    both Neon and Vercel. This is a point-in-time backup for disaster
    recovery, not a replacement for resolving ownership above; retention/
    rotation isn't automated yet.

### Service accounts (IMPORTANT — the project's default compute SA was deleted)

Every build and deploy MUST pin these explicitly or it fails with
"service account does not exist":

- **Build SA:** `three-ws-build@aerial-vehicle-466722-p5.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
  (pass via `--build-service-account` / `serviceAccount:` in cloudbuild.yaml)
- **Runtime SA:** `three-ws@aerial-vehicle-466722-p5.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
  (pass via `--service-account` on every `gcloud run deploy`)

Resolved (verified 2026-07-25): the build SA now holds `roles/run.admin` (plus
`cloudbuild.builds.builder`), and `gcloud builds submit` runs the full
build+push+deploy pipeline end to end. Recent deploys (revisions 00272, 00276)
were created by exactly this path, so no human-authed CLI finish is needed
anymore. If a future submit fails at the deploy step with a permissions error,
re-check this binding first: `gcloud projects get-iam-policy
aerial-vehicle-466722-p5 --filter="bindings.members:three-ws-build@"`.

## Deploying

```bash
# Frontend changed? Build first — dist/ ships from the local build.
# build:gcp = check:conflicts -> check:browser-graph -> check:tdz-bootstrap
# -> ensure:avatar-studio -> build:info:snapshot -> build:lib:full (the agent-3d
# UMD lib) -> build:avatar-sdk -> build:chat -> build (the site `vite build`)
# -> publish:lib -> build:info -> check:dist -> check:pages, IN THAT ORDER. The
# order is load-bearing: build:lib:full and build:avatar-sdk must run BEFORE the
# site build (it resolves avatar-sdk/src/agent.js against the copied bundle), and
# the site `vite build` WIPES dist/, so it must run before publish:lib mirrors the
# lib into dist/. Plain `npm run build` is NOT enough (skips the lib publish, so
# /agent-3d/latest/agent-3d.js 404s and the hero avatar dies). Hand-running
# `build:vercel` as the frontend build is also WRONG — it builds the SDK/lib
# sub-artifacts, not the static HTML pages, so dist/ has no /, /create, etc.
npm run build:gcp

# Build image on Cloud Build (32-vCPU + BuildKit layer cache) + push + deploy.
# Gated on check:dist, check:pages AND db:check so an incomplete dist/, an
# unreachable page, or an out-of-date database can no longer ship. Ends with a
# CDN purge and then smoke:prod against the live site.
npm run deploy:gcp

# Or do build + submit + CDN purge in one (from a clean worktree):
#   npm run deploy:gcp:full

# Verify the deploy actually landed — /api/version reports the live commit SHA
# and Cloud Run revision (stamped into dist/build-info.json by build:info):
curl -s https://three.ws/api/version | jq '{commitShort, branch, builtAt, revision: .runtime.revision}'

# Sweep every page declared in data/pages.json against the live site. deploy:gcp
# runs this automatically after the purge; run it standalone any time.
npm run smoke:prod
```

> Every entry in `data/pages.json` feeds the sitemap, `llms.txt` and
> `features.json`, so it is advertised to crawlers the moment it lands, whether
> or not anything can serve it. `server/index.mjs`'s `resolveStatic()` has no

**Database migrations** live in `api/_lib/migrations/*.sql` and are tracked in
the `schema_migrations` table (filename + sha256). Nothing applies them
automatically — the flow is:

```bash
npm run db:status    # dry run: list applied/pending against DATABASE_URL
npm run db:migrate   # apply pending migrations (do this BEFORE deploy:gcp)
npm run db:check     # what deploy:gcp and deploy:gcp:submit run: exits 4 if anything is pending
```

- `DATABASE_URL` comes from `.env.local` and must point at the production Neon
  DB (the same value the Cloud Run service uses).
- Never edit a migration file after it has been applied — the runner detects
  the sha256 drift and refuses (exit 3). Roll forward with a new file.
- Apply migrations before deploying the code that needs them: migrations are
  additive, so old code + new schema is safe; new code + old schema is not.
  When that order is inverted the symptom appears far from the cause: on
  2026-08-14 `/api/healthz` reported the EVM agent index `unknown` with
  `column "blocks_behind" does not exist`, because the code that reads and
  writes those columns shipped while
  `20260813210000_erc8004_crawl_head_tracking.sql` was still pending. Submit
  through `npm run deploy:gcp:submit` (or `deploy:gcp`), never a bare
  `gcloud builds submit`, so `db:check` gets its say.
- `db:migrate` stops at the first migration that fails and reports every
  migration still queued behind it (exit 5). Those are unapplied: the schema is
  behind the code by exactly that list until the failing file is fixed with a
  NEW migration and the run drains the rest.

- Lockfile unchanged → layer cache skips the workspace `npm ci`: **~3–5 min**.
- Lockfile changed → full install: **~12 min**.
- If the pipeline's deploy step fails on IAM (see above), deploy the pushed
  image directly:

```bash
gcloud run deploy three-ws-api \
  --image us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/aerial-vehicle-466722-p5/cloud-run-source-deploy/three-ws-api:latest \
  --project aerial-vehicle-466722-p5 --region us-central1 \
  --allow-unauthenticated --memory 2Gi --cpu 2 --timeout 900 \
  --service-account three-ws@aerial-vehicle-466722-p5.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

**Rollback (instant):**
```bash
gcloud run revisions list --service three-ws-api --region us-central1 --project aerial-vehicle-466722-p5
gcloud run services update-traffic three-ws-api --region us-central1 \
  --project aerial-vehicle-466722-p5 --to-revisions <good-revision>=100
```

**Logs:** use the reader CLI; it handles `jsonPayload` and request-log
entries that a raw `textPayload` read silently misses. Full guide incl. the
automated triage monitor: [gcp-logs.md](gcp-logs.md).
```bash
npm run logs                       # three-ws-api, last hour (vercel logs equivalent)
npm run logs:tail                  # live tail
npm run logs:errors                # ERROR+ across all services, last 6h
npm run triage:gcp                 # healthz + fleet log sweep -> classified action plan
```

**Build-context gotcha:** the upload is governed by the **allowlist** in
[.gcloudignore](../../.gcloudignore). If a handler starts reading a directory
at runtime that isn't allowlisted, it will be missing from the image — add the
directory there. `animation-sources/` (2.6 GB) is deliberately excluded; the
few endpoints reading it degrade until it moves to object storage.

**Not yet created:** a Cloud Build GitHub trigger (push-to-deploy like Vercel
had). Requires connecting the `nirholas/three.ws` repo in Cloud Build and
adding the vite build into the Docker build. This is Cloud Build's own GitHub
integration — not GitHub Actions, which this repo does not use.

**`/ingest/*` (PostHog proxy):** on Vercel, `vercel.json` routes whose `dest`
is an absolute URL (`/ingest/static/*` → `us-assets.i.posthog.com`, `/ingest/*`
→ `us.i.posthog.com`) were proxied by the platform itself. `server/index.mjs`
now replicates this with its own external-dest middleware (mounted before the
body parsers, so POST event bodies stream through unconsumed) — added
2026-07-07 after prod was serving 404s + a MIME-sniffing block on
`/ingest/static/array.js`. If a future `vercel.json` route gets an
`http(s)://` dest and analytics start 404ing again, check that this
middleware's `phase1Routes` walk still matches it before the API/static
phases.

---

## Crons (Cloud Scheduler)

The schedules in `vercel.json` `crons` are mirrored to Cloud Scheduler jobs in
us-central1, mostly named `cron--api-cron-<name>` (a few older ones use a bare
name, so **match by target URI, not by job name**, when auditing). Vercel's crons
died with the deployment, so there is no double-fire risk.

**The mirror is not automatically enforced: verify it after editing `crons`.**
Declaring a cron in `vercel.json` does nothing on its own; only the sync script
below creates the job. That gap has bitten repeatedly (on 2026-07-25 five
declared crons had no scheduler job at all and had therefore never run in
production: `kol-tracker-refresh`, `forge-thumbnail-backfill`,
`forge-off-crown`, `quality-bench`, `confirm-pending-purchases`; again on
2026-08-14 for `retention-rollup` and `likeness-eval`), so audit with the two
checks rather than by eye:

```bash
# Which declared crons are missing, paused, or on a different schedule than
# vercel.json says? Needs a live gcloud session; add --json for a report.
# Each MISSING row also says WHY, from production's own answer on that path:
#   "deployed, never synced" -> the handler is live and only the job is absent,
#                               so the sync below fixes it right now.
#   "handler not deployed"   -> the path 404s, so its job belongs to the deploy
#                               that ships the handler; syncing now would only
#                               schedule a 404 every run.
npm run check:cron-drift

# Do the handlers behind them route, load, run, and refuse an anonymous caller?
npm run audit:cron-liveness
```

```bash
# Sync after editing crons in vercel.json. Idempotent create-or-update, and
# CONFIG ONLY: it never changes whether an existing job is running, so it is safe
# to re-run during an incident hold. A job it creates starts ENABLED.
CRON_SECRET=<value> node scripts/create-gcp-scheduler.mjs

# Blanket run-state levers, explicit and mutually exclusive:
CRON_SECRET=<value> node scripts/create-gcp-scheduler.mjs --pause   # stop the whole fleet
CRON_SECRET=<value> node scripts/create-gcp-scheduler.mjs --resume  # recover from --pause

# List / pause / force-run one job. Note the DOUBLE hyphen after the `cron`
# prefix: the cron path's leading slash becomes a hyphen of its own, and a
# single-hyphen name fails with NOT_FOUND.
gcloud scheduler jobs list --location us-central1 --project aerial-vehicle-466722-p5
gcloud scheduler jobs pause  cron--api-cron-economy-tick --location us-central1 --project aerial-vehicle-466722-p5
gcloud scheduler jobs run    cron--api-cron-uptime-check --location us-central1 --project aerial-vehicle-466722-p5
```

**CRON_SECRET:** was EMPTY on Vercel (every cron guard fail-closed with 503 —
Vercel crons had been silently dead). A real secret was generated 2026-07-07
and set in two places: the Cloud Run service env and every Scheduler job's
Authorization header. **Recover it any time from either place:**

```bash
gcloud scheduler jobs describe cron--api-cron-uptime-check --location us-central1 \
  --project aerial-vehicle-466722-p5 --format="value(httpTarget.headers)"
```

---

## Environment variables

All service env lives on the Cloud Run service (view/edit):

```bash
gcloud run services describe three-ws-api --region us-central1 \
  --project aerial-vehicle-466722-p5 --format=yaml | grep -A2 'name:'
gcloud run services update three-ws-api --region us-central1 \
  --project aerial-vehicle-466722-p5 --update-env-vars KEY=value
```

### ⚠️ THE MIGRATION TRAP — read this before trusting any env export

`vercel env pull` silently returns **EMPTY values for secret-type vars** —
144 of 173 keys pulled blank (only integration-injected vars like
`DATABASE_URL` came through). The plaintexts are not retrievable from Vercel
by CLI at all. Consequences and current state:

1. The initial 157-var application contained mostly empty strings.
2. The `S3_*` group + real values for ~90 keys were recovered from the owner's
   own env archives (owner-provided dump, 2026-07-07) and staged as an 89-var
   validated set (deduped, other-project keys pruned, JWKS verified). **If the
   staging machine is lost before application, the set must be rebuilt from
   the owner's archives** — the sources are the owner's saved env dumps; the
   selection rules are: skip `VERCEL*`/`NX_*`/`TURBO_*`/`PG*`/`POSTGRES_*`/
   `NEON_*`/`DATABASE_URL*`/`REDIS_URL`, skip keys not referenced by this
   codebase, last-occurrence-wins on duplicates.
3. Verify state empirically, not from dashboards: an endpoint returning
   `503 {"error":"not_configured"}` means a `Missing required env var: X`
   line in the logs names the exact var.

### Vars with no default that silently kill a whole subsystem

`CIRCULATION_ENABLED=1` is the master gate for the circulation engine
(`api/_lib/circulation.js`, driven by `pulse-tick` via `economy-tick`) — the
engine that generates the Money Pulse's agent-to-agent activity. It is OFF by
design when unset, so it does not show up as a `503 not_configured` or any log
error: every tick just reports a clean `skipped: "disabled"`. This is exactly
how the 2026-07-07 migration killed the pulse for ten days — the var existed
only on Vercel, was never carried to Cloud Run, and nothing alerted. Restored
2026-07-17 (`--update-env-vars CIRCULATION_ENABLED=1`; the treasury secret
`CIRCULATION_TREASURY_SECRET` already rides on Secret Manager
`wallet-sol-engines-b58`). When auditing env completeness, check the
`economy` section of `/api/status` for engines reporting `disabled`, not just
5xx responses.

### Known-missing (blocked on owner)

| What | Vars | Impact | Recovery |
|---|---|---|---|
| Ops-alert Telegram push | `TELEGRAM_ALERTS_CHAT_ID` | `api/_lib/alerts.js` degrades to table-only (`ops_alerts`): no push notification for treasury-low, balance-floor, or breach alerts. This is why the 10-day Money Pulse flatline never pinged anyone. `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` survived; only the private ops chat id was lost in the migration. | Owner supplies the private ops chat/DM id (never the public holders' channel) and applies `--update-env-vars TELEGRAM_ALERTS_CHAT_ID=<id>`. |

### x402 ring payer float — why an empty wallet used to storm Solana

The autonomous loop (`api/cron/x402-autonomous-loop.js`, driven every minute by
`economy-tick`) spends real USDC against the platform's own paid endpoints. Two
independent limits apply, and for a long time only one was enforced:

- the **daily spend cap** (`remainingCap`) bounds what the loop is *allowed* to spend;
- the **payer's USDC balance** bounds what it is *able* to spend.

With a drained float and cap headroom remaining, each tick probed for a 402,
signed a payment transaction, and POSTed it — and the self-hosted facilitator
failed every one at settle with `broadcast_failed:Simulation failed`. Observed:
**1,665 failed settles against 3 successes** over 24h. Nothing was lost (the
transaction fails in simulation, before broadcast, so no fee is burned and no
funds move), but the ring did no useful work and hammered the RPC indefinitely.

`readPayerUsdcAtomic()` is now read once per tick and treated as a hard spend
ceiling. Its three-way contract is load-bearing, and `tests/x402-autonomous-payer-float.test.js`
pins it:

| Read result | Meaning | Loop behavior |
|---|---|---|
| a number > 0 | real float | pay up to `min(dailyCap, float)` |
| `0` | genuinely empty (**including a wallet with no ATA**) | skip every paid call; free + `run()` monitors still execute |
| `null` | balance **undeterminable** (RPC blip) | do *not* gate — leave the spend path open |

The `null`-vs-`0` distinction matters in both directions: if a transient RPC
failure read as `0`, one blip would silently halt the ring; if an empty wallet
read as `null`, the doomed-payment storm returns. Emptiness is detected
structurally (`getAccountInfo` → `null` ⇒ no token account ⇒ no USDC), not by
pattern-matching an RPC error string, whose wording varies by provider.

To resume autonomous spend, fund the payer's USDC float. The loop self-recovers
on the next tick — no redeploy, no flag flip.

The sponsor's SOL floor gate has the opposite default. Its balance read can also
come back `null`, and until 2026-08-28 that read as "not paused": all four paid
RPC lanes were over quota at the moment the sponsor sat at 0.000899 SOL, so the
loop spent three hours signing payments that could not settle (95 attempts, 0
settled). An unreadable balance is not evidence of solvency, so a `null` read now
defers to `sponsorKnownBelowFloor()` (`api/_lib/x402/self-facilitator.js`), which
the settle path itself writes when the chain rejects the sponsor for
rent-exemption. That second opinion costs no RPC call, so the gate still answers
when the RPC does not.

### Ops alerts: dashboard-primary (2026-07-12)

Ops alerting used to be Telegram-only, and Telegram-only meant that with no chat
configured **every** `sendOpsAlert()` was a silent no-op — 5xx faults,
`api/client-errors.js` browser reports, ring-leak CRITICALs, and low-balance
warnings all dropped. That is why the x402 payment storm below ran for a day
unnoticed.

Now every `sendOpsAlert()` **always** persists to the `ops_alerts` table
(`api/_lib/alerts.js`, migration `20260712000000_ops_alerts.sql`), keyed by the
alert's stable signature so a recurring condition is one row with a growing
`count`, not a flood. Read the active feed from the `ops_alerts` table or the
`x-ops-secret`-gated ops APIs (`/api/ops/health` and friends; the gate is
`authorizeOps` in `api/_lib/ops-auth.js`: admin session or a dedicated
`OPS_SECRET`, deliberately never `CRON_SECRET`, fail-closed in production).
This is the primary sink and needs no third-party service.

Telegram is now an **optional extra push**, off by default. When both
`TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` and `TELEGRAM_ALERTS_CHAT_ID` are set, alerts also push to
that private chat (deduped per signature for 1h, capped at 20/h). It is
deliberately unset in production — the dashboard is the channel. `/api/healthz`
reports `alerts.primary: "ops_alerts"` and `alerts.telegram_push:
"disabled"|"enabled"`; a disabled push is expected, not a fault. The
`@threewsbot` token remains in Secret Manager (`telegram-bot-token`) for
user-facing bot use (e.g. changelog push to holders); it is **not** wired to ops
alerts. To turn the extra push on, add `@threewsbot` to a private ops chat, read
its id from `getUpdates`, and set `TELEGRAM_ALERTS_CHAT_ID` (+ point
`TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` at the secret).

### Resolved: x402 sponsor co-signing key (2026-07-09)

`/api/healthz` reported `x402.sponsor_cosign: "missing"` and every sponsor-mode
settlement (club-cover, dance-tip) failed with `sponsor_key_unconfigured`.

Root cause: `X402_FEE_PAYER_SOLANA` advertised
`2wKupLR9q6wXYppw8Gr2NvWxKBUqm4PPJKkQfoxHDBg4` — a **third-party facilitator's
shared fee-payer account that three.ws has never controlled**, left over from
when Solana settlement went through an external facilitator (see
`ARCHITECTURE.md`). The self-hosted facilitator cannot co-sign for a key it does
not hold, so it 502'd at settle while passing every other health check.

An earlier revision of the table above described that address as a three.ws ring
wallet that "custodies funds — do NOT regenerate." **That was wrong**, and it
would have blocked the correct fix indefinitely. Evidence: the account fee-pays
~200 tx/hour for many unrelated co-signer wallets, none of them involving our
`payTo`, while our own cosign was provably unconfigured. Its balance was never
ours. `scripts/audit-service-wallets.mjs` has always flagged it correctly and
told operators to override the var.

Fix applied:

- Generated a three.ws-controlled sponsor with `scripts/x402-ring-setup.mjs --roles=sponsor`
  (sponsor role **only** — the funded `payTo` treasury was never touched):
  `GGf9qBhJDCe1UUz4s4Vxq1uPPvcv7UW7sJTuj2Yo5XQj`.
- Stored the secret in **Secret Manager** as `x402-fee-payer-secret-base58`
  (granted `roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor` to `three-ws@…`) and wired it as a
  `secretKeyRef`, rather than a plaintext env value on the service. This also
  removes the "secret only exists on whatever machine ran the script" fragility.
- Funded it with 0.05 SOL (floors: `X402_SPONSOR_SOL_FLOOR_LAMPORTS` = 0.02 hard
  refuse-to-settle, 0.03 audit/topup).

```bash
gcloud run services update three-ws-api --region us-central1 \
  --update-env-vars X402_FEE_PAYER_SOLANA=GGf9qBhJDCe1UUz4s4Vxq1uPPvcv7UW7sJTuj2Yo5XQj \
  --update-secrets X402_FEE_PAYER_SECRET_BASE58=x402-fee-payer-secret-base58:latest
```

Verified by a real $0.01 USDC mainnet sponsor-mode settlement through
`POST /api/x402-facilitator/settle` (tx
`5rmLnLUmWK7jJCjP6RJPLmwT2oiifQMmTnQmhoQKeZcVogxnTMvxB77fpb5BqMyV6VzbawXdPgWz2N7C5kXqqbQ5`):
the sponsor signed as fee payer, paid the 10001-lamport fee, and $0.01 landed in
`payTo`. `sponsor_cosign` now reports `ready`.

### Resolved: Upstash Redis + full signer wiring (2026-07-09, same day, later)

Owner supplied the Upstash database and the wallet secrets. Applied on revision
`three-ws-api-00029-c45`:

- **Upstash Redis live**: `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` (plaintext) +
  `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` (Secret Manager `upstash-redis-rest-token`).
  `X402_ALLOW_MEMORY_FALLBACK` **removed** per the escape-hatch's own
  instructions. healthz cache backend now reports `upstash healthy`; money
  limiters rate-limit for real instead of failing closed.
- **Signer slots wired** per `scripts/wire-master-wallet.mjs` ASSIGNMENTS, from
  the three economy wallets (`wwwww…ccrU` x402 loop, `wwwqv…HGUn` SOL engines,
  `WwwuGbq…3WwW` treasury face). Secrets live in Secret Manager
  (`wallet-x402-treasury-b58/b64`, `wallet-sol-engines-b58/b64`,
  `wallet-economy-master-b58/b64`) as `secretKeyRef`s — no longer only on one
  machine. `ECONOMY_MASTER_SECRET_BASE58`, `X402_TREASURY_SECRET_BASE58`,
  `X402_SEED_SOLANA_SECRET_BASE58`, `A2A_PAYER_SOLANA_SECRET` were concurrently
  set (same wallets) by another session and left as-is.
  `LAUNCHER_MASTER_SECRET_KEY_B64` deviates from the map (deployed on
  `X4o2…astML`, map says `wwwqv`) — left deployed value; `LABOR_ESCROW` skipped
  per the script's own live-funds guard.
- **Proof, full user path** (not just the facilitator): real paid calls through
  the live endpoints returned 200 + product content —
  club-cover $0.01 (tx `54FQ4rAFjfgF9b5pDRCB5dnhWNoTK7RrvJm2EJAuNGQDiMAPcLGptXpWzdBys49KHEASH7JrKb8sHL3AFwZT36gF`, pass issued)
  and dance-tip $0.001 (tx `2hSvvR17hpawE1ZjhgHisaEpRzYkh6jyWtWBgsoCKAhunQkhcUCfQQ49aY2QmfsCYNBaMpvVTxSBfky5t7tstUZ6`, thriller ticket).
  `scripts/audit-service-wallets.mjs` against the live revision: **all checked
  wallets configured, funded, and consistent** (14/15 signers; only the
  intentionally-excluded collection authority remains).

### Resolved: self-hosted Memorystore Redis, off the Upstash free tier (2026-07-10)

The Upstash free database (`saving-titmouse-110599`) hit its hard **500k
commands/month** cap within hours — that ceiling is far too small for this
platform (the rate limiter alone spends 2–3 commands per request). Redis then
errored on every command, the cache circuit opened, and paid endpoints were only
saved by the durable Postgres rate-limit fallback (commit `a1b0b9610`). The free
tier does not reset until the 1st, so the fix was to **stand up our own Redis on
the GCP credit pool** — permanently ending the third-party quota dependency.

Architecture (all in `aerial-vehicle-466722-p5`, `us-central1`; app code
UNCHANGED — it still speaks the `@upstash/redis` REST dialect):

```
three-ws-api (Cloud Run)
  ├─ VPC connector "three-ws-vpc" (10.8.0.0/28), egress private-ranges-only
  │    → only RFC1918 dests traverse the VPC; all external calls (RPC, LLM
  │      APIs) stay on the direct public path (no Cloud NAT needed, no egress
  │      bottleneck).
  └─ UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL = http://10.128.15.228   (internal LB IP)
     UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN = secret:srh-proxy-token
        │
Regional internal Application LB (10.128.15.228:80)
  forwarding-rule "three-ws-redis-fr" → target-http-proxy "three-ws-redis-tproxy"
  → url-map "three-ws-redis-urlmap" → backend "three-ws-redis-be"
  → serverless NEG "three-ws-redis-neg"
  (proxy-only subnet "three-ws-proxy-only" 10.100.0.0/23; firewall
   "three-ws-allow-proxy-subnet" + "three-ws-allow-connector-to-ilb")
        │
Cloud Run "three-ws-redis-proxy" (hiett/serverless-redis-http:0.0.10, pinned;
  ingress internal-and-cloud-load-balancing; SRH_TOKEN=secret:srh-proxy-token;
  SRH_CONNECTION_STRING=redis://10.234.231.139:6379; on VPC connector three-ws-vpc)
        │
Memorystore Redis "three-ws-redis" (basic, 1 GB, redis_7_0) @ 10.234.231.139:6379
```

Why this shape: the org blocks `allUsers` invocation (domain-restricted
sharing), so a *public* REST proxy is unreachable (its SRH bearer token collides
with the Google auth token Cloud Run would demand). Fronting the proxy with a
**regional internal LB** and reaching it over the VPC connector keeps the proxy
off the public internet AND keeps the app's external egress on the fast direct
path. The connector + Redis env are **pinned in `server/cloudbuild.yaml`** so a
full-config redeploy can never silently drop Redis back to the capped Upstash
tier.

Verified 2026-07-10 on revision `three-ws-api-00052-kbg`: `/api/healthz`
overall `ok`, cache backend healthy (the client self-labels "upstash" — it is
our Memorystore); proxy access logs show a steady stream of `POST 200`
`/pipeline` commands; the old Upstash endpoint stayed capped and untouched
(proving the app moved off it); and a real $0.01 club-cover settlement completed
end to end (tx `4fWXfymUxwS7YRMrkQqHwwgtA1GiEAmnJXsgYaXHo5NvyAqhisGkmU3k7waLD85RsVx5s4mXmB4ymiTuEvzAWnQ8`).

Cost ≈ $75/mo on the credit pool (Memorystore ~$35, proxy min-1 ~$13, connector
~$9, internal LB ~$18). To retire: repoint `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL/TOKEN` at a
managed Upstash paid plan and delete the four `three-ws-redis-*` LB resources +
proxy + Memorystore + connector. The `upstash-redis-rest-token` secret and the
`saving-titmouse` free DB are now unused (kept for rollback).

| What | Vars | Impact | Recovery |
|---|---|---|---|
| OKX X Layer facilitator creds | `OKX_API_KEY`, `OKX_SECRET_KEY`, `OKX_PASSPHRASE` (or, as a no-OKX-account fallback, `X402_XLAYER_RELAYER_KEY`) | `xlayerSettleable()` (`api/_lib/x402-xlayer-okx.js`) is false without one of these, so **no 402 challenge on any endpoint advertises the `eip155:196` (X Layer) rail**, confirmed live 2026-07-08 via `/api/okx/3d/health` (`payment-rail.settleable:false, facilitator_configured:false`) and by inspecting the raw 402 `accepts[]` on `/api/okx/3d/identity-studio` and `/api/okx/3d/pose-seed` (Solana + Base only, no X Layer entry). `X402_PAY_TO_XLAYER` and `X402_ASSET_ADDRESS_XLAYER` **are** set in prod, so this is the only missing piece. This is the exact rail OKX's listing review requires (agent #2632 rejection reason). The credential has since been set: probed live 2026-09-09, all four paid Forge rows advertise `eip155:196` and OKX's own `agent x402-check` reads `valid: true` on each. Treat this row as the recovery path if that ever regresses; the relisting order is `prompts/finish/911-okx-ai-08-forge-relisting.md`. | OKX Web3 developer console (owner) for the three real creds, or generate `X402_XLAYER_RELAYER_KEY` as a fresh EVM keypair + fund it with OKB gas as a stopgap that needs no OKX account. |

## DNS / TLS / CDN

- Registrar + DNS: **Namecheap** (nameservers `registrar-servers.com`).
  Web records: `A @ → 136.68.246.178`, `A www → 136.68.246.178`. Everything
  else there (privy/world CNAMEs, TXT/DKIM) is mail/verification — untouched
  by the migration.
- TLS: Google-managed cert `three-ws-cert` (three.ws, www.three.ws) — went
  ACTIVE 2026-07-07 ~18:40 UTC, auto-renews. Status:
  `gcloud compute ssl-certificates describe three-ws-cert --global --project aerial-vehicle-466722-p5`
- CDN: Cloud CDN on `three-ws-backend`, `USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS` — the vercel.json
  asset rule (7-day cache on glb/png/woff2/…) is what the CDN honors.
- The Cloud Run URL `https://three-ws-api-lp642k3kpa-uc.a.run.app` serves the
  identical site and bypasses the LB — useful for isolating LB vs service
  issues.
- **`www.three.ws` is a duplicate host, not a second origin.** Its A record and
  the managed cert both cover it, so it reaches the same backend, but the apex
  is the only origin the platform declares: `server/seo-head.mjs` pins every
  canonical URL to `https://three.ws` and the media bucket's CORS read rule
  allowlists that origin alone. Measured 2026-09-09 on one bucket object: the
  apex gets `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://three.ws` back, `www` gets no
  header at all, so every GLB fetch on a www page was blocked by the browser.
  `server/index.mjs` now redirects the whole www host to the apex (301 on
  GET/HEAD, 308 on everything else so a write keeps its method and body), and
  `tests/server-canonical-host.test.js` locks in that no other host, including
  the `*.run.app` URL above and `dev.three.ws`, is touched. Do not add a second
  serving hostname without either widening the bucket policy to match or
  redirecting it here too.

### Client geo header (analytics country column)

`api/_lib/client-geo.js` resolves a visitor's country from an edge geo header
and never from the raw IP. On Vercel that header was `x-vercel-ip-country`, set
by the edge for free. **The GCLB sets no geo header by default**, so after the
2026-07-07 migration `widget_views.country` and `widget_chat_threads.country`
went null for every row (verified: 49/49 populated in May, 0/27 in August), and
the `top_countries` panel on `/api/widgets/:id/stats` renders empty for every
widget.

The reader now prefers `x-client-geo-location`, then `x-client-region`. Populate
one on the backend service to restore capture (owner-gated: this is a
production LB change, not a Cloud Run config update):

```bash
gcloud compute backend-services update three-ws-backend --global \
  --project aerial-vehicle-466722-p5 \
  --custom-request-header='X-Client-Region:{client_region}'
```

`{client_region}` is the GCLB variable for the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code of the
client. Confirm with `gcloud compute backend-services describe three-ws-backend
--global --format='value(customRequestHeaders)'`, then check capture:

```sql
select count(*) filter (where country is not null), count(*)
from widget_views where created_at > now() - interval '1 day';
```

Until that header exists the code degrades to null rather than guessing, which
is the intended behavior. Note the LB does not strip an inbound copy of these
headers, so a client can forge one; `clientCountry` validates every value down
to two ASCII letters so the worst case is a visitor mislabeling its own row.

## Verifying after any change

```bash
B=https://three.ws
for p in / /3d /changelog /api/healthz /api/feed /api/explore?limit=4; do
  curl -s -m 25 -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}  $p\n" "$B$p"; done
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code} → %{redirect_url}\n" http://three.ws/   # expect 301 → https
```

`/api/healthz` is designed to stay green through dependency outages — read its
JSON body (x402 block, monitor block) for subsystem truth.

---

## What Vercel still holds (decommission checklist)

- The project + its env vars (plaintexts unreadable, but delete only after the
  ring secrets question is settled — the dashboard may still be useful to a
  human with owner access).
- `@vercel/og` remains a code dependency (runs fine on Cloud Run — plain Node).
- `vercel.json` is now a **live config file consumed by server/index.mjs**
  (routes + crons) — do NOT delete it as "Vercel leftovers".
- The `deploy` npm script still points at Vercel; superseded by `deploy:gcp`.
