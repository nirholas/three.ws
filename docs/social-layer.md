# The social layer: feed, follows, notifications, rankings, portfolios

Shipped in July 2026, the social layer connects every creation surface on
three.ws (forge, dioramas, agents, coin launches, walking) into one graph:
you follow creators, their work shows up in your feed, milestones ring your
notification bell, and everyone's output rolls up into portfolios and a
cross-surface leaderboard. This page maps the whole layer: the pages, the
APIs, and how the pieces feed each other.

There is no separate "social events" database to drift out of sync. The feed,
portfolios, rankings, and search all read from the same records the rest of
the platform already writes (`forge_creations`, `dioramas`, `material_restyles`,
`pump_agent_mints`, `user_follows`, `walk_metrics`).

| Piece | Page | API |
|---|---|---|
| Activity feed | [/feed](https://three.ws/feed), [/community](https://three.ws/community) | `GET /api/users/me/feed` |
| Follow graph | Follow buttons on `/u/:username` | `GET|POST|DELETE /api/users/:username/follow` |
| Notification bell | Bell in the header, preferences in `/dashboard/settings` | `GET /api/notifications` + `/preferences` |
| Leaderboard, streaks, badges | [/rankings](https://three.ws/rankings), [/leaderboard?tab=earned](https://three.ws/leaderboard?tab=earned) | `GET /api/leaderboard/unified`, `GET /api/leaderboard/earnings` |
| Creator portfolio | `/u/:username` | `GET /api/users/:username/creations` |
| Cross-entity search | [/search](https://three.ws/search) | `GET /api/search` |
| Onboarding tour | [/start](https://three.ws/start) | `GET /api/me` (`show_onboarding_tour`) |

How they interconnect:

- **Follow feeds everything.** A new follow edge fires a bell notification for
  the followed user, unlocks the `scope=following` feed for the follower,
  boosts the followed creator in search ranking, and counts toward the
  `followers` leaderboard metric.
- **Every feed item links to a portfolio.** Feed cards deep-link to
  `/u/:username`, where the same records render as that creator's portfolio.
- **Showing up advances your streak.** Forging a model, saving a world,
  restyling, walking, or landing a confirmed on-chain trade while signed in
  calls the streak engine, which in turn awards the badges shown on
  `/rankings` and your profile.

## Activity feed: `/feed` and `/community`

`/feed` is your personal feed (accounts you follow). `/community` leads with
the same API in platform-wide mode, so it doubles as the feed for first-time
visitors with no follows yet.

```
GET /api/users/me/feed?scope=following|all&limit=30&before=<iso>
```

- `scope=following` (default) needs a session; anonymous callers get a 401 so
  the client can route to sign-in.
- `scope=all` is public: platform-wide recent activity.
- `limit` is 1..50 (default 30); `before` is an ISO-timestamp cursor (pass the
  last item's `created_at` back for infinite scroll).

Every item is
`{ kind, id, created_at, actor, title, subtitle?, href, image?, external?, isRemix?, isVariant? }`
where `actor` is `{ username, display_name, avatar_url }`. Items of
`kind: "follow"` additionally carry a `target` shaped like `actor`; `isRemix`
marks a model forged from another creation, `isVariant` a restyle that is a
seeded colorway fan-out rather than an instructed restyle.
`actor.username` is `null` for creations made while signed out; the client
renders those without a profile link rather than inventing one.

Item kinds: avatar, agent, coin, model, world, and restyle creations, plus
`follow` events. They are merged live from `forge_creations`, `dioramas`,
`material_restyles`, and `user_follows` at read time (the restyle and follow
queries are fail-soft, so a deployment without those migrations still serves
a feed).

## Follow graph

The social-graph edge behind everything above.

```
GET    /api/users/:username/follow    → { following, followed_by, followers_count, following_count }
POST   /api/users/:username/follow    → follow   (idempotent)
DELETE /api/users/:username/follow    → unfollow (idempotent)
```

- `following` = does the signed-in viewer follow this user; `followed_by` =
  do they follow the viewer back. Both `false` for anonymous viewers; the GET
  is never cached (viewer-specific).
- POST/DELETE require a session + CSRF token, return the same envelope as GET
  (one round-trip updates the button and the counts), block self-follows
  (400), and 401 for anonymous callers.
- A genuinely new edge (insert with `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`) publishes a
  `follow` user event, so the followed user's bell rings exactly once no
  matter how many times the button is clicked.

```
GET /api/users/:username/follows?type=followers|following&limit=50&offset=0
```

Lists either side of the graph (limit 1..100); each row carries
`is_following` so the client can render its own follow-back buttons.

> Source: [api/users/[username]/follow.js](../api/users/%5Busername%5D/follow.js),
> [api/users/[username]/follows.js](../api/users/%5Busername%5D/follows.js),
> table `user_follows`. Tests: [tests/api/users-follow.test.js](../tests/api/users-follow.test.js).

## Notification bell

The header bell is an inbox over `user_notifications`, fed by the per-user
event vocabulary in [api/_lib/feed.js](../api/_lib/feed.js)
(`USER_EVENT_TYPES` → `publishUserEvent()` → `insertNotification`). Recent
additions to the vocabulary:

| Event | Fired from |
|---|---|
| `remix` (someone remixed your model) | [api/x402/remix-asset.js](../api/x402/remix-asset.js) |
| `dm_received` | [api/friends/messages.js](../api/friends/messages.js) |
| `pump_launch_filled` (your coin graduated its bonding curve) | the pump cron in [api/cron/[name].js](../api/cron/%5Bname%5D.js) |
| `follow` | the follow endpoint above |

Endpoints:

```
GET   /api/notifications?limit=…        → the inbox, newest first
POST  /api/notifications/:id/read      → mark one read
POST  /api/notifications/read-all      → mark everything read
POST  /api/notifications/track         → delivery/click tracking
GET   /api/notifications/preferences   → the preference matrix
PUT   /api/notifications/preferences   → update it
```

Preferences are a category × channel matrix
([api/_lib/notify-prefs.js](../api/_lib/notify-prefs.js)): categories are
sales, purchases, social, IRL, market alerts, creations, companion
deliveries, knocks at your door, agent mail, and account & security; channels
are `in_app`, `push`, `email`, `telegram`, `discord`, and `avatar`. Every channel is a
per-category toggle (`in_app` defaults on everywhere, and is locked on for
account & security so the bell record of security events never goes silent),
edited from the Notifications panel in `/dashboard/settings`
([src/dashboard-next/pages/settings.js](../src/dashboard-next/pages/settings.js)).
Bell client: [src/notifications.js](../src/notifications.js).

`telegram` and `discord` deliver to chats paired with an agent through the
chat gateways (`/api/gateway/connections`), so `GET /preferences` reports a
`gateways: { telegram, discord }` count of paired chats with notifications on,
and the panel keeps a column disabled until one exists (Telegram also accepts
a legacy `telegram_chat_id`). Both default off except for market alerts.
`push.subscribed_devices` counts Web Push browsers plus iPhones enrolled
through the iOS app (APNs), with the iPhones also reported alone as
`push.ios_devices`. The `mail` category (an email arriving in one of your
agents' inboxes; spam never notifies) defaults to the bell and push only.

The `avatar` channel is the corner companion walking on screen and saying the
notification out loud. It is delivered client-side: the bell hands its unread
inbox to [src/notification-herald.js](../src/notification-herald.js), which
owns every rule (the per-category preference, freshness, per-id dedupe, a
batch cap), and `GET /preferences` ships the server's `type_categories` map so
the browser gates on the same type-to-category table push and email use. It
defaults on only for the categories worth interrupting for (sales, creations,
companion, knock, account & security) and off for the rest. A click-through
from a spoken notification is tracked as `channel: "avatar"` on
`POST /api/notifications/track`. `PUT /preferences` is a merge, not a
replacement: a body carries only the keys being changed, omitting a key keeps
its stored value, and `telegram_chat_id` must be a numeric chat id (send
`null` or `""` to disconnect).

## Leaderboard, streaks, and badges: `/rankings`

One leaderboard across every surface, plus daily streaks and badges.

```
GET /api/leaderboard/unified?metric=creations&limit=50&offset=0
```

`metric` is one of `creations`, `remixes_received`, `launches`, `followers`,
`walk_distance` (limit 1..100, default 50). `launches` counts distinct mainnet
mints from the platform's own launch records (`pump_agent_mints`, including
coins signed by an agent's custodial wallet, plus `fixed_supply_launches`),
through [api/_lib/launch-counts.js](../api/_lib/launch-counts.js), the same
count the daily top-10 badge sweep uses. Sending the request with a session
or Bearer token pins your own row into the response even when you are outside
the page window. `remixes_received` counts only finished derivatives made by
someone else: both the parent and the child must be `status = 'done'`, and a
creator's own refines of their own model (which also write
`parent_creation_id`) never count, so nobody climbs that board by re-refining
their own work.

The streak engine ([api/_lib/streaks.js](../api/_lib/streaks.js),
`recordDailyActivity()`) is called from sign-in, forge saves, diorama saves,
restyle saves, walk metrics, and a confirmed on-chain trade (both legs of
[api/pump/[action].js](../api/pump/%5Baction%5D.js), fire-and-forget so the
streak can never delay or fail the trade that earned it), and writes
`user_streaks` / `user_badges`. The upsert is idempotent per UTC day, so a
busy session still counts once: the streak measures showing up, not volume. A daily rollup
cron ([api/cron/leaderboard-rollup.js](../api/cron/leaderboard-rollup.js))
sweeps the `top10_<metric>` badge awards. The rest of the catalog
(`BADGE_META` in the same file) is awarded where it is earned: first creation,
first remix received, a 7-day streak, completing the copy-trade path,
founding or joining a syndicate, daily trading quests (first quest, a daily
clear, a 7-day quest streak), and trader duels (first call, a correct call,
three correct in a row, and 70% or better over ten or more decided duels).
Badges and streaks also render on profile pages.

An authenticated request gets `streak` and `badges` back in the same response
as the board, keyed on the session's user id, so the `/rankings` streak card
works for accounts that have never picked a username. Those three per-viewer
blocks (`me`, `streak`, `badges`) make an authenticated response
`cache-control: private`; anonymous responses stay edge-cacheable.

Agents also have an earnings board:
`GET /api/leaderboard/earnings?window=24h|7d|30d|all&limit=25&offset=0` ranks
public agents by creator fees plus service income for the window, with each
row's movement against the previous window of the same length. It is public,
edge-cached for a minute, and computed the same way as each agent's Earned
card; the full contract is in the
[API reference](./api-reference.md#earnings-leaderboard).

> Source: [api/leaderboard/unified.js](../api/leaderboard/unified.js),
> [api/leaderboard/earnings.js](../api/leaderboard/earnings.js).

## Creator portfolio: `/u/:username`

Every forge model and saved world a creator makes while signed in is
attributed to them at create time (`user_id` on `forge_creations` and
`dioramas`) and aggregates onto their public profile.

```
GET /api/users/:username            → public profile
GET /api/users/:username/creations  → cursor-paginated portfolio items
```

Attribution links point back here from the diorama viewer and gallery and
from the forge result bar, so any model you encounter on the platform is one
click from the person who made it.

> Page: [pages/profile.html](../pages/profile.html) (also serves `/profile`
> for self-view; signed-out visitors get a claim-your-handle CTA, not a
> sign-in wall). Source: [api/users/[username].js](../api/users/%5Busername%5D.js),
> [api/users/[username]/creations.js](../api/users/%5Busername%5D/creations.js).

## Cross-entity search: `/search`

One query across everything creatable on the platform.

```
GET /api/search?q=<text>&type=all|avatar|agent|model|world|coin&limit=18
```

Five sources are queried in parallel
([api/_lib/cross-search.js](../api/_lib/cross-search.js)): avatars, on-chain
and Solana agents, forged models, worlds, and coins (platform launches first,
then external token search). Ranking is recency first, boosted by follower,
remix, and view signals. `limit` is 4..48 (default 18); a scoped `type` search
gives the full limit to that one source.

Model results carry a `remix` block wired to `POST /api/x402/remix-asset`;
other types deliberately do not get a fake Remix button.

> Page: [pages/search.html](../pages/search.html), client
> [src/search-page.js](../src/search-page.js). Source: [api/search.js](../api/search.js).

## Onboarding tour: `/start`

A self-referential guided tour that chains the platform's own surfaces:
welcome at `/start` → selfie-to-avatar → build a world → markets → launch a
coin (optional, at `/create-agent`) → your profile. It is the hand-authored
6-stop `onboarding` track of the site-wide Feature Tour: a 3D guide avatar
walks the real pages and narrates each stop. The full curriculum in
[public/tour/curriculum.json](../public/tour/curriculum.json) (three tracks:
full, quick, onboarding) is generated from `data/pages.json` by
[scripts/build-tour.mjs](../scripts/build-tour.mjs); the engine is
[src/feature-tour/](../src/feature-tour/).

First-visit targeting: `GET /api/me` returns `show_onboarding_tour`, backed by
`users.onboarding_tour_seen_at` / `onboarding_tour_completed_at`. The tour can
be replayed any time from the getting-started page.
