# Docs: Reputation Staking Market

Stake conviction on an agent, earn from its attested action history. The
Reputation Staking Market turns the existing `threews.stake.v1` conviction
signal into escrowed positions: principal sits in a market escrow, yield is
derived per epoch from the agent's signed on-chain attestations, and a
withdrawal returns principal plus earnings in one settlement transaction.

The load-bearing contract is
[specs/REPUTATION_STAKING_MARKET.md](https://github.com/nirholas/three.ws/blob/main/specs/REPUTATION_STAKING_MARKET.md)
(`rsm.v1`). This page is the walkthrough; when the two disagree, the spec wins.

Live surface: [/reputation/market](/reputation/market).

## What the market pays for

Reputation is already attested on Solana as signed SPL-Memo envelopes indexed
into `solana_attestations` (see [docs/solana-reputation](./solana-reputation.md)).
An agent's `threews.accept.v1`, `threews.task.v1`, `threews.validation.v1`,
`threews.feedback.v1`, `threews.dispute.v1`, and `threews.revoke.v1` envelopes
are its attested action history: work it shipped, validations it passed or
failed, and reviews it earned.

The market reads exactly that history and pays stakers for backing agents
whose history is real. Each epoch (one UTC day) a fixed reward pool splits
across every open position in proportion to:

```
posWeight = principal × epochFraction × agentWeight
```

where `agentWeight` comes from the agent's attestations that epoch: passed
validations and accepted tasks count as work, failed validations, disputes,
and revocations count as faults (at double weight), and the 1-5 feedback scale
sets a quality multiplier. The full table, rounding rules, and constants live
in spec §5; the only implementation is `src/shared/reputation-staking.js`,
which runs identically on the server and in the browser.

Two consequences worth knowing before you stake:

- **An idle agent earns nothing.** Zero attested work in an epoch means
  `agentWeight === 0` for that epoch, so its stakers earn zero that epoch.
  Principal is never at risk; conviction on a quiet agent is just unrewarded.
- **Positions are never slashed.** Bad conviction is punished by zero yield,
  not confiscated principal. The market expresses trust; it does not
  underwrite an agent's losses.

## Networks

| Network | Status | What it costs |
|---|---|---|
| devnet | open | Nothing. Airdropped lamports, the free proof path. |
| mainnet | owner-gated | Writes refuse with `mainnet_gated` until the owner sets `REPUTATION_MARKET_ALLOW_MAINNET=1` on the service. |

Opening mainnet is one owner action, one command:

```bash
gcloud run services update three-ws-api --region us-central1 \
  --update-env-vars REPUTATION_MARKET_ALLOW_MAINNET=1
```

Everything below works on devnet today, unchanged.

## Stake

A stake is a transaction **you** sign and broadcast; the market never signs it.
One transaction, two instructions: a transfer of your principal to the market
escrow, and an SPL Memo envelope tagged `market: "rsm.v1"` naming the agent,
your 1-5 conviction score, and the escrow. The transaction signature is your
position id.

From the page, connect a Solana wallet on [/reputation/market](/reputation/market),
pick an agent, choose an amount (minimum 0.001 SOL) and a conviction score, and
sign. The page then calls `POST /api/reputation/market-stake` with the
signature; the server verifies the transaction against the chain (memo shape,
escrow match, balance delta) and indexes the position. Verification is a chain
read, so no caller can assert a principal the chain did not record.

From code, `stakeOnMarket` in `src/solana-stake.js` builds the exact
transaction:

```js
import { stakeOnMarket } from '/solana-stake.js';

const signature = await stakeOnMarket({
	agentAsset: agent.solanaAsset,   // the agent's Solana asset pubkey
	escrow,                          // from GET /api/reputation/market
	lamports: 5_000_000n,            // 0.005 SOL
	score: 4,                        // 1-5 conviction
	network: 'devnet',
	wallet,                          // a connected wallet adapter
});
await fetch('/api/reputation/market-stake', {
	method: 'POST',
	headers: { 'content-type': 'application/json' },
	body: JSON.stringify({ signature, network: 'devnet' }),
});
```

## Earn

The position starts accruing in the epoch it opens, for the fraction of the
day it was actually open. Pending earnings recompute on every read; they are
only fixed when a settlement lands. Watch them on the positions section of
[/reputation/market](/reputation/market) or read them directly:

```bash
curl "https://three.ws/api/reputation/market-positions?staker=<wallet>&network=devnet"
```

Every position row carries a per-epoch breakdown, so the number the page
quotes is auditable against the spec, epoch by epoch.

## Withdraw

There is no lockup. Withdraw any time. Only the wallet that opened a position
can withdraw it: sign the text
`threews.unstake.v1:<network>:<stake signature>:<issued_at>` with that wallet
(`issued_at` is the current time in milliseconds; the server accepts it for 5
minutes) and send the base58 signature as `proof`. The
[/reputation/market](/reputation/market) page does this for you with one
wallet prompt and no fee.

```bash
curl -X POST https://three.ws/api/reputation/market-withdraw \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"signature": "<stake signature>", "network": "devnet", "proof": {"issued_at": 1760000000000, "signature": "<base58 wallet signature>"}}'
```

The market escrow signs one settlement transaction paying principal plus
earnings back to the staker recorded on-chain, with a `threews.unstake.v1`
memo carrying both numbers. Only the escrow ever signs a settlement, and it
pays only the on-chain staker, so nobody can route your payout to themselves.

Withdrawal is idempotent: the position flips to `settling` before the payout
is signed, so a crash is retried, never double-paid; a second withdrawal of a
`closed` position returns the original settlement.

One solvency rule (spec §2): earnings can never exceed the escrow's reward
surplus. If accrued earnings exceed the surplus, the payout clamps to the
surplus and the settlement records `clamped: true`. Principal always returns
in full.

### What a withdrawal does to the agent's reputation

Settling retires the conviction the stake expressed. The agent's reputation card
(`GET /api/agents/solana-reputation`) counts what is **still** staked, so your
position drops out of `stake.total_lamports` and out of `stake.top_stakers` the
moment the settlement lands. Backing an agent and then walking away does not
leave a permanent endorsement behind.

The history is not erased: `stake.gross_lamports` still reports everything ever
staked and `stake.retired_lamports` what settlement gave back, so "1 SOL staked,
3 SOL withdrawn" stays distinguishable from "1 SOL staked". Only the market
escrow's settlements retire anything, so nobody can deflate an agent's standing
by writing a memo naming somebody else's stake. Spec §3.3.

## Verify it yourself

The database behind the market is an index, not the ledger. Every position is
re-derivable by replaying the chain: positions from `threews.stake.v1` memos
into the escrow, settlements from `threews.unstake.v1` memos out of it.

`scripts/reputation-market-proof.mjs` runs the whole contract against Solana
devnet with airdropped lamports: fund, stake, verify, accrue against real
attested action history, withdraw, and re-read the chain to confirm the
settlement. It takes no arguments:

```bash
node scripts/reputation-market-proof.mjs
```

### When the faucet says no

The public devnet faucet rate-limits per source IP, so a shared machine (a
Codespace, a CI runner, an office network) can find it already exhausted by
someone else and the run stops at `fund` with a 429. The proof does not depend
on the faucet: fund any devnet keypair once at
[faucet.solana.com](https://faucet.solana.com), then hand the proof its secret
and it funds each run itself.

```bash
REPUTATION_MARKET_PROOF_FUNDER_SECRET_KEY=<base58 secret> node scripts/reputation-market-proof.mjs
```

The funder needs roughly 0.02 SOL per run and is only ever debited to the
throwaway staker the run generates. If it is short, the proof says which account
holds how much and what it needs, rather than failing at a later stage.

### When there is no faucet and no funded keypair either

A local validator needs nothing external at all: `solana-test-validator` bundles
the same SPL Memo program the attestations and the settlement memo use, and it
airdrops without limit, so the whole contract runs offline.

```bash
solana-test-validator --reset --ledger /tmp/rsm-ledger &
solana-keygen new --no-bip39-passphrase --silent --outfile /tmp/rsm-funder.json
solana airdrop 20 "$(solana-keygen pubkey /tmp/rsm-funder.json)" --url http://127.0.0.1:8899

SOLANA_RPC_URL_DEVNET="http://127.0.0.1:8899/?cluster=devnet" \
REPUTATION_MARKET_PROOF_FUNDER_SECRET_KEY="$(cat /tmp/rsm-funder.json)" \
node scripts/reputation-market-proof.mjs
```

Two details in that command are load-bearing. The `?cluster=devnet` suffix is
how the RPC layer infers the cluster (`inferNetwork` in
[`api/_lib/solana/connection.js`](../api/_lib/solana/connection.js)); a bare
localhost URL reads as mainnet and would queue mainnet endpoints as fallbacks
behind it. And the funder rung is used rather than the faucet because
`requestAirdrop` confirms over a WebSocket subscription, which a local validator
serves on a port the derived URL does not point at; every other stage of the
proof confirms over HTTP polling and works untouched.

## HTTP surface

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `/api/reputation/market?network=devnet` | GET | Agents ranked by net staked conviction, epoch weight, realized yield. |
| `/api/reputation/market-positions?staker=<wallet>&network=devnet` | GET | Every position a wallet holds, with pending earnings. |
| `/api/reputation/market-stake` | POST | Index a stake transaction. Body: `{ signature, network }`. |
| `/api/reputation/market-withdraw` | POST | Settle a position. Body: `{ signature, network, proof }`, where `proof` is the staker's signed unstake message. |

Failure codes (`market_not_configured`, `mainnet_gated`, `tx_not_found`,
`not_a_market_stake`, `stake_below_minimum`, `unknown_position`,
`already_closed`, `escrow_unsigned`, `proof_required`, `proof_expired`,
`not_staker`) are pinned in spec §9.
