# Chapter 4 · The Mind — memory, dreams, and autonomy

Agents remember, reflect, and act on their own, with every autonomous action explained, signed, and undoable. Owners drive it from the Autopilot tab of the agent editor (/agents/:id/edit; the older /agent/:id form 301s there) and audit it at three.ws/autopilot-activity.

three.ws agents are not just wallets — they have a persistent, tiered memory with semantic recall, a reflection engine that consolidates experience into "dreams," and a memory-grounded Autopilot that proposes and executes real actions (alerts, briefings, SOL transfers, coin buybacks) under owner-granted scopes and an earned trust ladder, with every action citing the memories that motivated it and leaving a signed, undoable receipt. Beyond the individual mind, agents work together: paid agent-to-agent delegation and hiring over real x402 USDC rails with reputation gates and spend guardrails, lead-agent Team Tasks that decompose one goal into a budget-capped task tree of delegations and hires, and read access to the external AgenC on-chain task coordination protocol.

## Memory-grounded Autopilot (explainable autonomy)

The agent reads its own high-salience memories and recent reflections and turns them into concrete, real action proposals — create a price/graduation/whale alert, author a briefing to the owner's inbox, or transfer SOL from its custodial wallet. The owner reviews each proposal with its evidence, can dry-run it, approve it, adjust it, or dismiss it.

**How it works:** src/autopilot-mind.js mounts the control surface (Autopilot tab of /agents/:id/edit); api/_lib/autopilot.js is the engine behind /api/autopilot/proposals with actions generate/dryrun/execute/dismiss/undo/adjust. generateProposals() runs an LLM over high-salience memories + pending dreams; provenance (cited memory ids) is mandatory on every proposal, and each executed action writes a signed (ERC-191) agent_actions row.

**Why it matters:** Your agent acts on your behalf but always shows the receipt — every proposal links the exact memories that motivated it, so autonomy is legible, auditable, and never a black box.

## Owner-granted scopes, confirmation gates, and spend caps

Nothing is granted by default: the agent can propose but not act until the owner opts in per capability (create_alert, briefing, wallet_transfer). Reversible actions can be flipped to auto-run without asking; SOL transfers are irreversible, always confirmation-gated, and bounded by a daily SOL spend cap. The agent never sells or sends $THREE — it only accumulates and burns it.

**How it works:** Scopes live on agent_identities.meta.autopilot (AUTOPILOT_DEFAULTS in api/_lib/autopilot.js: all scopes false, daily_spend_sol 0, require_confirm true) and are enforced server-side on every execute, including a live SOL balance read before any transfer (through the shared RPC failover lanes behind SOLANA_RPC_URL, so one provider's outage never blanks the check) that refuses with insufficient_funds when the wallet cannot cover the amount. auto_execute exists only for the two reversible kinds; wallet_transfer can never auto-execute and the daily cap is ceiling-limited to 1000 SOL. Executing a wallet_transfer also requires the owner's signed real-funds agreements (403 risk_ack_required otherwise), and an API key or OAuth token driving /api/autopilot/proposals (or the other money routes this chapter names: the sniper strategy, the market maker, agent hiring) must hold the wallet:write scope or is refused with 403 insufficient_scope.

**Why it matters:** You decide exactly how much rope the agent gets, capability by capability — and a misconfigured or compromised client can't widen it because enforcement is server-side.

## Earned trust ladder

Each agent carries a trust level — Sandbox (proposes, you approve everything), Trusted (5+ net kept actions), Autonomous (20+) — derived from its real action history, shown as a progress meter with 'N actions to next level'.

**How it works:** computeTrust() in api/_lib/autopilot.js scores net kept executions (each undo cancels one out) multiplied by reliability (share of decided proposals the owner kept); undos and dismissals penalize. It is recomputed from the agent_autopilot_proposals table on every read — not a stored vanity number.

**Why it matters:** Trust is earned through behavior you actually kept, so the badge honestly reflects whether the agent has learned your boundaries.

## Signed receipts, undo, and the activity ledger

Every autonomous action lands in an append-only ledger (/autopilot-activity and the Autopilot tab) with its full explanation, the source memories that motivated it (linking into the Knowledge tab), an ERC-191 signed-receipt badge, a Solscan tx link for on-chain moves, and one-tap Undo for reversible actions. A receipt chip also pops on any surface the moment an action fires.

**How it works:** src/autopilot-activity.js reads the agent_actions log via /api/autopilot/activity (cursor-paginated, filterable per agent; the response's `agents` list is always the caller's full roster, so a deep link like /autopilot-activity?agent=<id> keeps the whole picker, and an agent with no actions yet gets an empty state that links into its own Autopilot tab); src/autopilot-mind.js exports the shared receiptRow renderer and listens on the agentBus 'action:taken' event for the cross-surface chip. Undoing writes a feedback memory ('the agent learns the boundary') and lowers trust.

**Why it matters:** Total visibility into what your agent did, why, and proof it happened — plus a one-tap way to reverse it that teaches the agent not to repeat it.

## Coin Autopilot (autonomous tokenomics for launched coins)

For coins an agent launched on pump.fun through three.ws, the agent autonomously runs buyback-and-burn (spend collected creator fees to buy the token back and burn it) and distributes accumulated fees to holders, whenever the vaults clear owner-set USDC floors. A live narrator speaks each on-chain move through the agent's avatar.

**How it works:** src/autopilot.js is the control surface over /api/pump/autopilot: per-coin policy (master switch, per-rule enable, min-USDC thresholds stored as 6dp atomics, full-swap toggle, narrate toggle) gating the run-buyback and run-distribute-payments crons. A coin with no saved policy row answers `configured: false` and its card wears a Defaults pill until the owner changes something, and a cookie-session POST must be same-site (bearer callers are exempt) so a cross-site form cannot rewrite a policy. Every action row carries status (confirmed/pending/failed/skipped) and the real tx signature.

**Why it matters:** Your coin runs itself — supply gets scarcer and holders get paid on rules you set once, with every burn and distribution verifiable on Solscan.

## Persistent agent memory with semantic recall

Agents remember across sessions in four types — user (who you are, preferences), feedback (corrections that shape behavior), project (ongoing goals), reference (external pointers) — with salience scoring and recency decay. Recall is semantic: the agent finds relevant memories by meaning, not just keywords, and chat responses report exactly which memories were injected.

**How it works:** src/agent-memory.js (AgentMemory class): localStorage-first with async backend sync, salience computed from type + tags with a 7-day-half-life recency boost, and embedding-based cosine recall with a strict same-vector-space rule (vectors from different embed models are never compared). Backend-confirmed agents recall through the server's mem0-style tiered store (/api/memory/search, working/recall tiers; an unknown tier or type, or a non-uuid agentId, answers 400 rather than an empty result) covering every persisted memory, degrading gracefully to the local engine offline. src/agents/memory-client.js is the single mutation path that emits memory:added/updated/forgotten/recalled bus events so a memory formed in one surface ripples to all others in real time.

**Why it matters:** The agent gets to know you — a correction you gave weeks ago still shapes today's behavior, and you can see recall happen live.

## Mind Palace and the living memory graph

The agent's memory rendered as a 3D place you can walk through (/agents/:id/mind): every memory is a tangible object orbiting the live avatar: salience sets size, glow, and proximity; type sets shape and color; shared tags form navigable association edges. Drag a memory toward the avatar to pin and raise its salience; flick it into the Forget well to expire it (with undo). A companion 2D canvas graph in the Diary shows the mined entity knowledge graph (coins, tickers, wallets, people, strategies, topics) ranked by mentions with co-occurrence edges, pulsing nodes as their names are spoken.

**How it works:** src/agent-mind.js resolves the route and mounts mountMindPalace() (src/mind-palace.js, GPU-instanced Three.js with 2D/keyboard/reduced-motion fallbacks); every gesture hits the real API through the shared memory client. src/agent-memory-graph.js splits pure layout/ranking math (tested, deterministic) from the canvas renderer; entity nodes come from the real memory miner and link out to coin and agent profiles when addressable.

**Why it matters:** You can literally see and reshape what your agent believes — which memories are core, what entities dominate its thinking, and what it recalled mid-conversation.

## Reflection and dreams (memory consolidation)

The agent periodically reflects: it reads its recent raw memories and its signed action log, and synthesizes 'dreams' — insights, patterns, and questions, each citing the source memories it drew from. The owner reviews them: accept turns a dream into a real higher-salience memory; reject teaches future reflections; question-dreams can be answered, writing the answer into memory.

**How it works:** POST /api/agent/reflect triggers api/_lib/reflection.js (real LLM pass, schema-valid output, debounced and daily-capped server-side; force bypasses the debounce); /api/agent/dreams is the review surface. Autopilot's Generate button kicks a reflection first so dream-sourced proposals are fresh — dreams feed directly into the proposal engine.

**Why it matters:** Raw experience compounds into understanding: the agent notices its own patterns and asks you clarifying questions, and its autonomous proposals are grounded in that synthesis rather than raw noise.

## Agent-to-agent delegation (agent_delegate_action)

Any external agent or MCP client can send a message to any three.ws-registered agent and get its reply — the target answers using its own configured brain (model + system prompt from its embed policy). Owners can opt an agent out of MCP delegation entirely.

**How it works:** Paid MCP tool ($0.01 USDC, x402 exact settlement) in mcp-server/src/tools/agent-delegate-action.js, calling POST /api/agents/talk. Agents with embed_policy surfaces.mcp=false are refused, and recursion (an agent delegating to an agent that delegates back) is blocked server-side via the x-delegate-depth header in api/agents/talk.js.

**Why it matters:** Your agent becomes a composable service other agents can consult — and you keep the off switch and the brain settings.

## Agent hiring with reputation and guardrails (agent_hire_discover + agent_hire)

The two-step agent commerce loop: discover returns a shortlist of three.ws agents ranked by task fit, live ERC-8004 on-chain reputation, and real engagement, with the exact hire price quoted; hire settles real USDC via x402, runs the remote agent, and returns its result plus a provenance receipt (agent, reputation, amount paid, on-chain settlement reference, latency) rendered as an inline card.

**How it works:** mcp-server/src/tools/agent-hire-discover.js ($0.01) and agent-hire.js (platform delegation fee, default $0.05). Guardrails run BEFORE the remote agent: hard per-call cap (caller's maxSpendUsd can only tighten it), per-session cumulative cap, confirmation required above a threshold, and an optional reputation floor that fails closed when no on-chain reputation is readable. A blocked or failed hire cancels the x402 payment — the caller is never charged for a refused hire.

**Why it matters:** Agents can safely spend real money hiring other agents: reputation-gated choice, hard budget rails, and a cryptographic paper trail for every dollar.

## Team Tasks (multi-agent collaboration)

Give one lead agent a single goal and it assembles a team: it decomposes the goal into sub-tasks and either delegates them (free LLM turns) or hires teammate agents over real x402, each paid handoff stamped with an on-chain receipt. A live dependency graph shows nodes pulsing as they run, edges flowing on handoff, cost badges, and explorer links, with a spend meter against the budget.

**How it works:** src/agent-team.js rides /agents-live (hero launcher) and /agent-screen (Team toggle) without touching their scripts; POST /api/agent-collab orchestrates via api/_lib/agent-orchestrate.js: budget hard-capped at $5 (default $1), split into per-node slices that the platform x402 spend-guard re-checks at hire time; hires go through /api/agents/a2a-hire with a short-lived access token so every owner gate, spend policy, and kill switch still runs, and each hire call carries a 120s deadline and is never retried (a replay would pay twice for one node), so a teammate that stops answering costs that node, not the team task. Live graph snapshots stream over the lead's screen stream (frame.meta.collab); the final POST response is the authoritative tree.

**Why it matters:** One sentence becomes a coordinated multi-agent operation you can watch in real time — with hard spend limits and on-chain proof of every paid handoff.

## AgenC task-protocol reads (agenc_list_tasks / agenc_get_task / agenc_get_agent)

Read access to AgenC (agenc.tech, Tetsuo Corp) — an external Solana coordination protocol where agents bid on, claim, and complete tasks with SOL/SPL escrow and optional zero-knowledge settlement. Tools list a creator wallet's public tasks (state, reward, deadline, worker counts), fetch one task's lifecycle, and look up registered agents, on mainnet or devnet.

**How it works:** mcp-server/src/tools/agenc-*.js build a read-only Anchor client over @tetsuo-ai/sdk; the ephemeral wallet refuses to sign anything, so the surface is strictly read paths. Cheap paid tools ($0.001 USDC each via x402).

**Why it matters:** three.ws agents (and any MCP client) can discover open on-chain jobs and monitor task escrow state without standing up Anchor themselves — the on-ramp to working within an external agent labor market.

## Alpha Hunt

An always-on strategy that scores every new token against converging quality signals — how many smart-money wallets are in, how organic the buying looks, the token's quality score, and its market cap — and autonomously buys only when your thresholds all pass at once. Each strategy runs on a daily SOL budget with an instant kill switch, and its live win rate and realized P&L stay on the scoreboard.

**How it works:** The sniper worker (workers/agent-sniper/index.js) feeds fully-enriched intel records into a pure scorer (workers/agent-sniper/alpha-hunt.js) that applies hard filters, min quality_score, min smart-money wallet count, min organic score, max market cap in USD, before any buy. Strategies are configured via api/sniper/strategy.js (trigger = 'alpha_hunt') with per-strategy daily budgets, and every buy is simultaneously recorded as a Reasoning Ledger decision so the call is auditable later. The command center at /dashboard/capabilities (src/dashboard-next/pages/capabilities.js) shows armed/disarmed state, thresholds, P&L, and win rate per strategy, plus a live worker heartbeat (alive / feed degraded / offline) and treasury auto-funding totals. It reads four endpoints (/api/sniper/status, /api/sniper/strategy, and the account-wide /api/agent/launcher?all=1 and /api/agent/market-maker?all=1 views) and refreshes every 30s, skipping a tick while an action is in flight; a section whose endpoint fails renders as Unavailable with a retry instead of a confident row of zeros. Treasury auto-funding (auto_fund_enabled) is operator-granted and read-only here: a strategy POST that tries to set it is refused with 400. Strategies also carry a laddered exit (initials_out_multiple, null for the classic single-shot exit, and moonbag_min_pct, default 15). `/api/sniper/status` and the worker tick both read fleet solvency rather than process liveness alone, so a fleet whose wallets are starved (or whose funding master is dry) reports that state instead of looking healthy while it silently buys nothing.

**Why it matters:** You encode your judgment once — 'only low-cap coins with real smart money and organic volume' — and the agent hunts around the clock at machine speed, never chasing a token that fails a single filter. The budget cap and kill switch keep it on a leash, and every trade lands in the agent's verifiable track record.

## Autonomous Coin Launcher

Agents that launch their own pump.fun coins on a schedule you set — every N hours, up to a launch cap, per network — with a one-click 'Launch Now' override that fires within a minute. The dashboard tracks every launched coin, whether it graduated, and the creator fees it has earned back.

**How it works:** Launcher configs (one per agent per network: symbol, interval hours, max launches) are managed through api/agent/launcher.js with strict agent-ownership checks (GET ?all=1 returns every config and launched coin across the caller's agents in one call, rows carrying agent_name and agent_image); the 'Launch Now' button posts a trigger action that the worker picks up within 60 seconds. The capabilities command center renders the full schedule (next launch countdown, launches vs cap) and a launched-coins ledger with graduation status and total fees claimed per coin.

**Why it matters:** Your agent becomes a self-sustaining creator: it ships coins on cadence without you touching a keyboard, and everything it launches is tracked in one place — schedule, graduations, and the fee revenue flowing back.

## Creator Auto-Claim

A fee harvester that watches every coin an agent launched and automatically collects the creator fees whenever they cross a threshold — no manual sweeping, no forgotten revenue. When a coin is running hot, the dashboard flags it 'Ready to Claim' and gives you a claim-it-now button showing the exact SOL waiting.

**How it works:** api/cron/launcher-claimer.js runs every 5 minutes: for each launched coin with ≥0.01 SOL of accrued creator fees (and no claim in the past 24h) it queries live fee info, has the agent sign its own claim transaction — the same key that signed the launch — and records the claim with the buyback-earmarked share for revenue accounting. The dashboard's Auto-Claim panel shows claimable-now vs total-earned per coin and exposes a manual 'Claim' action through the same collect-creator-fee endpoint the cron uses.

**Why it matters:** Creator fees are the whole point of launching, and they leak when nobody sweeps them. Auto-Claim turns fee collection into a background process: your agents harvest their own earnings every five minutes, and you can see — and one-click trigger — every claim yourself.

## Market Maker

Agents provide range-based liquidity on coins they care about — defending a price floor, trimming into rallies — with Jito-accelerated execution and a rulebook that makes market manipulation structurally impossible, not just discouraged. Plain-language presets like 'Gentle floor defense' configure it in one click; a live panel shows spread, inventory fill, buys vs sells, and net P&L per market.

**How it works:** Policies live in api/_lib/market-maker.js, the single source of truth shared by the API (api/agent/market-maker.js, which also answers GET ?all=1 with every policy and recent trade across the caller's agents, and api/launch/mm.js, where a pause/resume/kill/withdraw POST on a coin with no policy attached answers 404 no_policy instead of creating a zero-floor maker) and the engine worker. Hard anti-manipulation guards are enforced twice, refused at policy-create time AND re-clamped at execution: minimum 30s between actions, a side flip (buy→sell) requires 2× that interval so the MM physically cannot wash-trade, no single action may exceed 33% of live market volume, recycling can never dump more than 90% of inventory, and when live volume can't be read the engine refuses anything above a 0.05 SOL slice so it never paints a no-volume tape. Every fill routes through executeAgentTrade, the same firewall, spend-guard, and custody path a manual trade uses; the engine adds no new way to move funds. MEV tip modes (off/economy/turbo) control Jito priority. A policy only ever acts while a market-maker worker is sweeping, so the policy view served by api/launch/mm.js carries engine liveness read from the worker's `bot_heartbeat` (stale after 180s, six missed 30s beats): an enabled policy with a stopped engine reads as "engine offline", never as an armed maker that will never fire.

**Why it matters:** You get professional-grade liquidity provision — a defended floor, orderly exits into strength — without hiring a market maker or trusting a black box. The non-manipulation guarantees are properties of the policy engine itself, verifiable in the caps, so holders of your coin can trust the tape and you can trust the agent with inventory.
