# Pump.fun integration for Solana agents

Pump.fun is a Solana token launchpad, and three.ws agents can watch it live: an agent avatar reacts (speaks, gestures, emotes) as claims and token graduations happen, and the same activity feeds each agent's trust score. If you just want to see it, add the `pumpfun-feed` widget to an agent in Studio; this page documents the plumbing behind it for developers.

GitHub social-fee claims are classified by evidence. A real withdrawal alone
does not prove that a GitHub user created or endorses the coin. Only verified
repository-owner or creator-wallet relationships receive a positive
`first_claim` reputation signal; mismatched, unverified and pooled events remain
visible without increasing trust. Pooled withdrawals select no primary CA.

This integrates the upstream [`pumpfun-claims-bot`](https://github.com/nirholas/pumpfun-claims-bot) MCP server into the three.ws platform so a Solana agent can:

- Observe live pump.fun activity (GitHub social-fee claims, token graduations)
- React to events through the existing Empathy Layer (speak, gesture, emote)
- Expose enriched intel (`getRecentClaims`, `getTokenIntel`, …) via the platform MCP endpoint
- Feed off-chain trust signals into the Solana reputation score
- Surface a live cards overlay through a new widget type

This document covers what was added, how it composes with what was already there, and what is intentionally **not** included.

## Configuration

```env
# Upstream pumpfun-claims-bot MCP endpoint. Required to enable the integration.
PUMPFUN_BOT_URL=https://pumpfun-bot.example.com/mcp
PUMPFUN_BOT_TOKEN=                 # optional bearer for upstream auth

# Solana RPCs (also used by attestations crawler + pump-sdk skills)
SOLANA_RPC_URL=                    # mainnet (Helius/Triton recommended)
SOLANA_RPC_URL_DEVNET=
```

`PUMPFUN_BOT_URL` is an **optional enrichment layer**, not a hard dependency. When it's unset (the prod default), the `pumpfun-signals` cron still runs off the live WS-fed `pumpfun_graduations` table and the `pf:claims` / `pf:whales` / `pf:mints` Redis lanes — only the bot's richer claim intel (tier, GitHub account age) is skipped. The `op=claims` read proxy and watch skills soft-degrade to empty when the bot is absent. Solana agents that don't use it pay no cost.

The read proxy validates its request before that degrade, so the contract does not depend on the deployment's env: an unknown `op`, or `op=token` without `mint` / `op=creator` without `wallet`, is `400 validation_error` whether or not the bot is configured.

## Skills

All registered through `registerPumpFunWatchSkills` in [src/agent-skills.js](../src/agent-skills.js). The skills await their platform fetches inline in the agent's turn, so every one is bounded (8 s by default) and a stalled feed fails the skill instead of leaving the chat mid-reply forever.

| Skill | MCP-exposed | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `pumpfun-recent-claims` | ✅ | Returns latest N enriched claims |
| `pumpfun-token-intel` | ✅ | Returns full intel for a mint |
| `pumpfun-watch-start` | ❌ (browser-only) | Opens SSE; emits `speak`/`emote`/`gesture` per event |
| `pumpfun-watch-stop` | ❌ | Closes the stream |

### Reaction map (watch-start)

Reactions are computed by the shared dispatcher in [src/widgets/pumpfun-reactions.js](../src/widgets/pumpfun-reactions.js): each event is first distilled into a signal envelope (tier, market-cap multiple, dev track record, GitHub legitimacy, whale status), then mapped to a prioritized variant with an emote trigger, a gesture clip, and a spoken line. Representative variants:

| Variant | Trigger | Empathy Layer emote | Gesture | Speech sentiment |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `graduation_standard` | any graduation | `celebration` 0.9 (up to 1.0 for moonshots) | celebrate clip | +0.7 to +0.95 |
| `claim_first_verified` | first claim, verified GitHub | `celebration` 1.0 | `thriller` (6s) | +0.85 |
| `claim_first_raw` | unverified first withdrawal | `curiosity` 0.65 | `look_around` (3s) | 0 |
| `claim_fake` | fake claim detected | `concern` 0.85 | `shake` (1.8s) | -0.6 |
| `claim_tier_mega` / `_influencer` | repeat claim by tier | `celebration` 0.7 / `curiosity` 0.55 | short taunt/reaction | +0.5 / +0.3 |

These are continuous-blend stimuli, not discrete states — they decay according to the per-second rates in [agent-system.md](agent-system.md#5-the-avatar-emotion-system-empathy-layer).

## Reputation signals

The cron writes typed rows to `pumpfun_signals(wallet, agent_asset, kind, weight, payload, tx_signature)`. `solana-reputation` aggregates them as `pumpfun_signals: { count, weight, by_kind }` in the response, and the agent-passport card surfaces a `pumpfun` block. The `/api/pump/channel-feed` `signal` lane renders them as live, agent-attributed feed cards.

### Sources (no upstream bot required)

The cron is **not gated on the optional `PUMPFUN_BOT_URL`** — every lane has a real, always-on source, and the cron emits whatever is live:

| Lane | Source | Actor wallet |
|---|---|---|
| graduations | `pumpfunMcp.graduations()` → the WS-fed `pumpfun_graduations` table (kept fresh by the `pumpfun-graduations-sync` cron), or the bot when configured | `creator` / `dev_wallet` |
| claims | bot `getRecentClaims` (rich tier/age intel) when configured, merged with the `pf:claims` Redis lane | `claimer` / `github_wallet` |
| whales | `pf:whales` Redis lane (first whale-buy events) | `buyer` |
| mints | `pf:mints` Redis lane (new token launches) | `creator` |

A signal is only written when the actor wallet is linked to a three.ws agent (`user_wallets` → `agent_identities`, Solana). Each lane keeps a Postgres cursor in `pumpfun_signals_cursor(source, last_seen_ms, …)` so a run only evaluates events newer than the last — no re-scanning the whole window. The cursor lives in Postgres (not Redis) to keep Upstash write volume flat; the cron makes **zero new Redis writes** — only `lrange` reads.

### Dedup key

Rows are unique on `(tx_signature, kind)`, not `tx_signature` alone — a single claim transaction can legitimately produce `first_claim` + `influencer` + `new_account` rows at once.

Default weights:

| Kind | Weight | Lane |
|---|---|---|
| `graduation` | +0.3 | graduations |
| `first_claim` | +0.2 | verified repository/creator-wallet claims only |
| `influencer` | +0.2 | claims |
| `whale_buy` | +0.1 | whales |
| `launch` | +0.05 | mints |
| `new_account` | -0.2 | claims |
| `fake_claim` | -0.6 | claims |

These are **off-chain** signals — flagged as such, not on-chain attestations. `verified=false` semantically. Weighting them into a final composite score is up to consumers; the endpoint exposes the raw aggregates.

---

## Widget

The `pumpfun-feed` widget renders a stack of cards (claim or graduation) as an absolutely-positioned overlay on top of the 3D viewer. With `autoNarrate: true`, the avatar narrates each event through the protocol bus. Each card's trading-terminal links come from the shared builder in [src/shared/trading-terminals.js](../src/shared/trading-terminals.js) (`terminalLinks(mint)` and `referralOffers()`), the same one the copy pages use, so adding or re-pointing a terminal is one change. The overlay carries no inline event handlers (a broken token image hides through the `data-fallback="hide"` hook), which is what keeps it inside the site's CSP.

Studio config schema (validated in `widget-types.js`):

```js
{
  kind: 'all' | 'claims' | 'graduations',
  minTier: '' | 'notable' | 'influencer' | 'mega',
  autoNarrate: true,
  maxCards: 8,                 // 1..50
}
```

## What's intentionally not included

- **Long-lived SSE** — the feed handler runs a 90s bounded loop and lets the browser auto-reconnect; the Cloud Run request handlers aren't meant to hold a connection open indefinitely. For higher throughput, deploy the bot itself as a streaming service.
- **On-chain signal attestations**: pump.fun signals are off-chain rows only. The platform's SPL Memo attestation layer exists (see [Solana reputation](solana-reputation.md)), but these crawled signals are not promoted into it; that remains a future step.
- **Agent-as-signer** — the watch skills are read-only; they never sign transactions. The existing `pumpfun-create / -buy / -sell` skills cover signing flows.
- **Anchor program for reputation** — still EVM-only on the on-chain path.

---

## Testing

```bash
npx vitest run tests/pumpfun-mcp.test.js tests/pumpfun-signals.test.js
```

The MCP client and cron crawler are unit-tested with mocked `fetch` and `sql`. End-to-end requires a live `PUMPFUN_BOT_URL` and is exercised via the Solana smoke test path.
