# Most Popular 3D GitHub Repositories

> Live snapshot pulled from the GitHub Search API on **2026-05-30**. Star counts are in thousands (k) and drift over time — re-run the methodology below to refresh.

## How this list was built

A sweep of 22 3D-related GitHub topics and keyword queries (`3d`, `threejs`, `webgl`, `webgpu`, `computer-graphics`, `rendering`, `raytracing`, `gaussian-splatting`, `nerf`, `point-cloud`, `3d-reconstruction`, `3d-printing`, `gltf`, `opengl`, `vulkan`, `mesh`, and more), 2 pages each. That yielded **3,284 unique repositories**, which were deduped and ranked by stars. A 3D-signal filter plus a hand-curated denylist removed false positives that ride in on broad topics — console emulators, 2D-only engines, ML-inference libraries that merely use WebGL, video tools, VPN/"service mesh" projects, and the like — leaving **~2,780 genuine 3D repos**. The top 200 are listed below.

> Note: classification is inherently fuzzy at the margins. A few entries (e.g. `raylib`, `libgdx`, `MonoGame`) are general game frameworks with strong 3D support; learning resources and "awesome-*" lists are included because they are central to the 3D ecosystem.

- **three.js (#1, ~113k)** dwarfs everything else in web 3D — it is the foundation this platform is built on.
- The **pmndrs / React ecosystem** dominates the React side: `react-three-fiber` (#5), `drei` (#42), `uikit` (#179). Framework wrappers exist for every stack: `troisjs/trois` + `Tresjs/tres` (Vue), `threlte` (Svelte), `gre/gl-react` (React shaders).
- The fastest-growing cluster is **NeRF + Gaussian Splatting** — `gaussian-splatting` (#10), `instant-ngp` (#16), `nerfstudio` (#33), `supersplat` (#48), `gsplat` (#96), plus generative 3D (`TRELLIS`, `Hunyuan3D`, `stable-dreamfusion`). This is where web-3D capture is heading and worth tracking for the platform roadmap.

Apply a 3D-signal regex filter over `description + topics` and a denylist of non-3D false positives (emulators, 2D engines, ML-inference libs, video/VPN tools), then take the top N. See git history for the exact filter used.
