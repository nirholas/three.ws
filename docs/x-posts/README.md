# X post drafts

Ready-to-paste X (Twitter) announcement copy and the video prompts that go with it. Internal
staging only: nothing here is posted automatically, and posting is owner-gated per
[`CLAUDE.md`](../../CLAUDE.md) (`git push` / publishing / posting to external channels needs
explicit approval). Each file states what it's for and what has already been verified true.

> **`@nichxbt` is suspended (reported 2026-08-27).** Nine of the drafts below pair a
> `@trythreews` post with a personal-voice quote tweet from `@nichxbt`, and that second half
> cannot be posted right now. Post the `@trythreews` half as written and hold the other one;
> do not move its copy onto the platform account. [`x-accounts.md`](../x-accounts.md) has the
> account status and the full rule.

## How these are written

- **Paste-ready, not outlines.** No placeholders, no "insert link here". Every link in a draft
  resolved when it was written. The one class that has since rotted is links into `@nichxbt`
  posts, which now serve X's suspension interstitial; check any `x.com/nichxbt/status/...` link
  before you paste a draft.
- **Character counts are measured, not guessed**, against X's rule that any URL counts as 23
  characters regardless of length. Where a draft states a count, it was computed.
- **Each file opens with a verified-claims block** and, where it matters, a "do not claim" list.
  That list is the useful part: it records what someone could disprove in ten minutes.
- **No em-dashes and no emoji**, matching the repo's writing rules.

## Companion threads for the AWS Builder Center articles

Long-form threads that stand on their own and pair with a draft in
[`aws-builder-center.md`](../aws-builder-center.md). Each ends with a labeled reply to add once its
article is live on the Builder Center, and each lists the preconditions that must hold before it posts.

## Conventions

Posting is manual and owner-gated. **X delivery of the changelog is retired** (owner directive
2026-07-18): `scripts/changelog-x.mjs` still exists but no cron calls it, so nothing in this folder
is on an automated lane. Treat every file here as copy waiting for a human to send.

Not registered in `data/pages.json`, and doesn't need to be: `scripts/audit-docs.mjs` only checks
direct `docs/*.md` files for a page entry, not files under a `docs/` subdirectory, so a nested
folder like this one is the convention for internal drafts that shouldn't be crawlable. When a
draft moves in here from the top level, drop its slug from `UNPUBLISHED_DOCS` in that script: the
entry is dead once the file is no longer routed.
