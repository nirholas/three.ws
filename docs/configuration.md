# Configuration Reference

three.ws is configured through a combination of environment variables and a handful of configuration files. This document is a complete reference for self-hosters and developers setting up a local development environment. If you only use the hosted site at three.ws, none of this applies to you; if you are running the code yourself, start with the [Minimum Local Development Configuration](#minimum-local-development-configuration) and come back for the rest as you enable features.

**Configuration files at a glance:**

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `.env.local` | Local development secrets and API keys |
| `vercel.json` | Routing, cron jobs, and response headers |
| `vite.config.js` | Build targets and dev server rewrites |
| `cors.json` | CORS policy applied to your S3/R2 bucket |
| `.mcp.json` | MCP server connection for Claude Code integration |

---

## Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` for local development. In production, three.ws runs on **Google Cloud Run** (service `three-ws-api`, region `us-central1`) — set these on the Cloud Run service, e.g. `gcloud run services update three-ws-api --region us-central1 --update-env-vars NAME=value`, or through the Cloud Console. See the full production runbook in [docs/ops/gcp-production.md](ops/gcp-production.md).

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

---

### Core

#### `PUBLIC_APP_ORIGIN`
**Required for self-hosted deployments.** The canonical origin of your deployment, with no trailing slash. When unset, the code falls back to `https://three.ws` ([api/_lib/env.js](../api/_lib/env.js)), which is wrong for any other domain.

```
PUBLIC_APP_ORIGIN=https://yourdomain.com
```

Used to construct absolute URLs in API responses and OAuth metadata (exposed to server code as `env.APP_ORIGIN`). Must match your production domain exactly.

#### `DATABASE_URL`
**Required.** PostgreSQL connection string using Neon's serverless HTTPS driver.

```
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:pass@ep-xxx.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require
```

Get from: [Neon](https://neon.tech) (free tier works for development), Supabase, or any PostgreSQL host. Always include `?sslmode=require` in production.

After setting this, provision the schema:

```bash
npm run db:bootstrap
```

This runs all four provisioning steps (core schema + indexer + delegations + migrations) and is idempotent — safe to re-run. Do not apply `api/_lib/schema.sql` alone: the base schema does not create the migration-defined tables and leaves a half-provisioned database (see [deployment.md](deployment.md)).

#### `JWT_SECRET`
**Required.** Long random secret used for two purposes: signing session JWTs and (via HKDF) deriving the AES-256-GCM key that encrypts agent wallet private keys.

```
JWT_SECRET=<base64 string>
```

Generate with:

```bash
openssl rand -base64 64
```

**Rotation:** add a new key ID (`JWT_KID`), wait for old tokens to expire, then remove the old value. Never remove the active signing key mid-rotation.

#### `JWT_KID`
**Optional.** Active key identifier for future key rotation. Defaults to `k1`.

```
JWT_KID=k1
```

#### `PASSWORD_ROUNDS`
**Optional.** bcryptjs cost factor for password hashing. Defaults to `11`.

```
PASSWORD_ROUNDS=11
```

Higher values increase security at the cost of login latency. 11 is a reasonable default for modern hardware.

---

### LLM

`/api/chat` routes across a provider failover ladder (see the routing comment at the top of [api/chat.js](../api/chat.js)): free-tier providers lead, paid keys are backstops. Configure at least one of these keys to enable agent conversations.

#### `GROQ_API_KEY`
**Recommended.** Free-tier Groq key; the default first provider in the chat ladder.

```
GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_xxxxx
```

#### `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`
**Optional.** OpenRouter key, tried after Groq. Backs up every LLM surface; fund it if you rely on paid-model failover.

```
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-xxxxx
```

#### `NVIDIA_API_KEY`
**Optional.** NVIDIA NIM free tier, a third independent free lane.

#### `SAMBANOVA_API_KEY`, `MISTRAL_API_KEY`, `ZAI_API_KEY`
**Optional.** Three more free lanes, tried after NVIDIA in that order: SambaNova Cloud, Mistral's Experiment tier, and Z.AI's GLM Flash lane. Each joins the ladder only when its key is present, so `/api/chat` degrades across providers without a code change. The server-side completion chain in [api/_lib/llm.js](../api/_lib/llm.js) also accepts optional Cerebras, Gemini AI Studio, Cloudflare Workers AI (`CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` + `CLOUDFLARE_AI_API_TOKEN`), and SiliconFlow lanes on the same free-first rule.

#### `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
**Optional (paid backstop).** Anthropic key, tried after the free lanes. Also accepted as a user-supplied BYOK key.

```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-xxxxx
```

Get from [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com). `OPENAI_API_KEY` fills the same paid-backstop role for OpenAI, and `GROK_API_KEY` (alias `XAI_API_KEY`) adds xAI Grok as the last paid rung; when it is unset the Grok rungs are skipped and only a user's own BYOK Grok key works. watsonx (`WATSONX_API_KEY` plus a project scope) is served only on explicit request, never as a silent default.

#### `CHAT_MODEL`
**Optional.** Pin a default chat model by id. It only applies when the provider that serves that model id (per the model catalog) is the one routed to; every other provider keeps its own default, so an Anthropic-style model id never leaks into a Groq request.

```
CHAT_MODEL=claude-sonnet-4-6
```

#### `CHAT_MAX_TOKENS`
**Optional.** Cap on tokens per chat response. Defaults to `1024`.

```
CHAT_MAX_TOKENS=1024
```

---

### Storage (S3-Compatible)

All four S3 variables are required to enable GLB file and thumbnail uploads. The service is S3-compatible and works with AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, Backblaze B2, and MinIO.

#### `S3_ENDPOINT`
**Required for non-AWS providers.** Full URL of the S3-compatible endpoint.

```
S3_ENDPOINT=https://<account-id>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com
```

Leave blank for standard AWS S3.

#### `S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
**Required.** Access key for your S3-compatible bucket.

```
S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
```

#### `S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
**Required.** Secret key for your S3-compatible bucket.

```
S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
```

#### `S3_BUCKET`
**Required.** Bucket name where avatars and assets are stored.

```
S3_BUCKET=3d-agent-avatars
```

#### `S3_PUBLIC_DOMAIN`
**Required.** Public CDN base URL for the bucket. Used to construct asset URLs in API responses.

```
S3_PUBLIC_DOMAIN=https://cdn.yourdomain.com
```

Use a custom domain for zero-egress delivery (Cloudflare R2 charges no egress on custom domains).

After setting up the bucket, apply the CORS policy — see the [`cors.json` section](#corsjson) below.

---

### Cache and Rate Limiting

#### `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL`
#### `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN`
**Recommended for production.** Upstash Redis for distributed rate limiting across serverless function instances.

```
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=https://xxx.upstash.io
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=xxxxx
```

Get from [upstash.com](https://upstash.com). Without Redis, rate limiting falls back to per-instance in-memory state — ineffective in a multi-instance serverless environment and a security risk in production.

#### `UPSTASH_CACHE_REST_URL`
#### `UPSTASH_CACHE_REST_TOKEN`
**Optional, recommended at scale.** A *second*, dedicated Upstash store for the best-effort response caches (galaxy feed, pulse, agent/explore lists, provider health). The variables above back the fail-closed rate limiter; the caches write much larger bodies. On a single shared free store those large writes contend for connections and burn the limiter's command quota — the cause of the `redis SET failed … aborted due to timeout` warnings on `/api/galaxy/flows`.

```
UPSTASH_CACHE_REST_URL=https://yyy.upstash.io
UPSTASH_CACHE_REST_TOKEN=yyyyy
```

Provision a separate store **co-located with your production Cloud Run region** (`us-central1`; cross-region latency is what pushes large `SET`s past the 3s client timeout). When unset, the cache transparently falls back to the rate-limiter store, then to in-memory — no behavior change. Verify the cutover on the Upstash dashboard: command traffic shifts to the new store and the limiter store's usage drops.

---

### Authentication

#### `VITE_PRIVY_APP_ID`
#### `PRIVY_APP_ID`
**Optional.** Privy app ID for social/email login. Two variables are needed: `VITE_PRIVY_APP_ID` is used client-side (embedded in the built JS), and `PRIVY_APP_ID` is used server-side to verify identity tokens in `/api/auth/privy/verify`.

```
VITE_PRIVY_APP_ID=clxxxxxxxx
PRIVY_APP_ID=clxxxxxxxx
```

Both should be the same value. Get from [dashboard.privy.io](https://dashboard.privy.io).

---

### Avatar Pipeline

#### `VITE_CHARACTER_STUDIO_URL`
**Optional.** Override for the origin where the three.ws avatar builder is hosted. When unset, the app resolves it **same-origin** to `<origin>/avatar-studio` (the Vite dev middleware serves `character-studio/build` there in dev; the build copies the same bundle to `/avatar-studio` in production). Set this only to point at a standalone studio dev server (e.g. `http://localhost:5173` while developing `character-studio/`).

```
VITE_CHARACTER_STUDIO_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

The three.ws avatar builder is an open-source 3D avatar editor (full body customisation — hair, clothing, accessories, skin tone, proportions). It runs as a separate Vite/React app under `character-studio/` in this monorepo and posts the exported GLB back to the parent via `postMessage`. It is fully compatible with the three.ws avatar runtime — same humanoid skeleton naming, ARKit `viseme_*` blendshapes, and Mixamo animation support.

#### `AVATURN_API_KEY`
**Optional.** API key for the photo-to-avatar pipeline. Used server-side by `/api/onboarding/avaturn-session` (`api/onboarding/[action].js`) to exchange selfie photos for a session URL.

```
AVATURN_API_KEY=xxxxx
```

Sign up through the [Avaturn developer docs](https://docs.avaturn.me/).

#### `AVATURN_API_URL`
**Optional.** Override for self-hosted or staging photo pipeline deployments. Defaults to `https://api.avaturn.me`.

```
AVATURN_API_URL=https://api.avaturn.me
```

#### `VITE_AVATURN_EDITOR_URL`, `VITE_AVATURN_DEVELOPER_ID`
**Retired; no code reads them.** Both still appear in `.env.example`, but the photo pipeline no longer builds an editor URL in the browser: `src/avatar-creator.js` opens the `@avaturn/sdk` editor against the session URL that `/api/onboarding/avaturn-session` mints server-side from `AVATURN_API_KEY`. Setting either variable changes nothing.

#### `AVATAR_REGEN_PROVIDER`
**Optional.** Platform provider for avatar regeneration and reconstruction: `replicate`, `huggingface`, or `gcp` (`api/_lib/regen-provider.js`). When unset the provider is inferred from credentials, paid first: `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN` selects Replicate, then `GCP_RECONSTRUCTION_URL` the self-hosted Cloud Run worker, then `HF_TOKEN` the HF Spaces queue; with none of those the platform provider is `none` and the reconstruct endpoint falls back to a user's stored BYOK key (Meshy, Tripo) before answering `501`.

```
AVATAR_REGEN_PROVIDER=replicate
```

---

### Blockchain and Permissions

#### `PERMISSIONS_RELAYER_ENABLED`
**Optional.** Enables the server-side ERC-7710 delegation relayer endpoint (`POST /api/permissions/redeem`). Defaults to `false`.

```
PERMISSIONS_RELAYER_ENABLED=false
```

#### `AGENT_RELAYER_KEY`
**Conditional.** Hex private key of the relayer EOA that pays gas for `redeemDelegations`. Required when `PERMISSIONS_RELAYER_ENABLED=true`. This is the server's relayer key, not a user key.

```
AGENT_RELAYER_KEY=0x...
```

Generate a fresh wallet:

```bash
node -e "const {Wallet} = require('ethers'); const w = Wallet.createRandom(); console.log(w.privateKey, w.address)"
```

Never commit a real value. Rotate via the Cloud Run service env vars (`gcloud run services update three-ws-api --region us-central1 --update-env-vars AGENT_RELAYER_KEY=…`).

#### `AGENT_RELAYER_ADDRESS`
**Conditional.** EIP-55 checksummed address derived from `AGENT_RELAYER_KEY`. Fund with testnet ETH before enabling the relayer.

```
AGENT_RELAYER_ADDRESS=0x...
```

#### `RPC_URL_<CHAINID>`
**Optional.** Per-chain RPC URL overrides. Pattern: `RPC_URL_` followed by the chain ID. Defaults to public RPC endpoints, which are less reliable under load.

```
RPC_URL_84532=https://sepolia.base.org        # Base Sepolia
RPC_URL_11155111=https://rpc.sepolia.org      # Ethereum Sepolia
```

Use Alchemy or Infura URLs in production for reliable RPC access.

---

### IPFS Pinning

At least one pinning provider is needed to enable on-chain avatar registration via IPFS.

#### `PINATA_JWT`
**Optional (preferred).** JWT for IPFS pinning via Pinata.

```
PINATA_JWT=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

Get from [app.pinata.cloud/keys](https://app.pinata.cloud/keys).

#### `WEB3_STORAGE_TOKEN`
**Optional (fallback).** Token for IPFS pinning via Web3.Storage (legacy v1 API).

```
WEB3_STORAGE_TOKEN=xxxxx
```

#### Solana signer keys (`*_SECRET_KEY_B64`)
**Optional.** Server-side Solana keypairs the cron jobs and on-chain flows sign with: `PUMP_CRON_RELAYER_SECRET_KEY_B64` (pays tx fees for the Pump.fun buyback cron), `COIN_TREASURY_SECRET_KEY_B64`, `THREE_BUYBACK_SECRET_KEY_B64`, `CLUB_SOLANA_TREASURY_SECRET_KEY_B64`, `PUMP_X402_LAUNCHER_SECRET_KEY_B64`. Each is the **base64 encoding of the 64 raw secret-key bytes**, the format `decodeSecretKey` expects (`api/_lib/solana-signers.js`).

```
PUMP_CRON_RELAYER_SECRET_KEY_B64=<base64 of 64-byte keypair>
```

Generate with the bundled, dependency-free generator (no `@solana/web3.js` install needed):

```bash
# Writes the secret to .env and prints the public key to fund with SOL
node scripts/gen-solana-signer-key.mjs --var PUMP_CRON_RELAYER_SECRET_KEY_B64 --write

# Or print to stdout (swap the var for any of the *_SECRET_KEY_B64 names)
node scripts/gen-solana-signer-key.mjs --var COIN_TREASURY_SECRET_KEY_B64

# Grind a vanity public key (case-insensitive prefix; base58 has no 0/O/I/l)
node scripts/gen-solana-signer-key.mjs --vanity www
```

**Fund the printed public key with SOL** before the relayer can pay fees. `--write` refuses to clobber an existing value, so rotating means removing the old line first. In production a relayer key is a credential, so it goes in Secret Manager rather than on the service as a literal: `node scripts/migrate-plaintext-secrets.mjs --only <NAME> --apply` moves an existing one, and `docs/ops/wallet-key-migration.md` has the commands for publishing a new version. Never commit the secret. Read production's current value with `node scripts/read-service-env.mjs '^<NAME>$' --raw`; a `vercel env pull` export returns empty for secret-type vars and must not be trusted.

---

### Minimum Local Development Configuration

The smallest `.env.local` that runs the dev server with core features:

```env
PUBLIC_APP_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:pass@ep-xxx.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require
JWT_SECRET=<output of: openssl rand -base64 64>
GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_...          # or any other chat provider key (see LLM above)
S3_ENDPOINT=https://<account-id>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com
S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...
S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
S3_BUCKET=3d-agent-avatars
S3_PUBLIC_DOMAIN=https://cdn.yourdomain.com
```

Avatar creation, blockchain features, and IPFS are all optional for local development.

---

## `vercel.json`

A **live configuration file** consumed at runtime by the Cloud Run server ([`server/index.mjs`](../server/index.mjs)), not a Vercel leftover. The server reads its `routes` array (route table, security headers, rewrites) on boot; the `crons` list is read by [`scripts/create-gcp-scheduler.mjs`](../scripts/create-gcp-scheduler.mjs) to sync the Cloud Scheduler jobs (the server itself never reads it). The `routes` array maps incoming URL patterns to destination files or API handlers.

**Key route patterns:**

```json
{ "src": "/agents/([^/.]+)/edit",  "dest": "/agent-edit.html" }
{ "src": "/agents/([^/.]+)/embed", "dest": "/agent-embed.html" }
{ "src": "/agent/([^/]+)/edit",  "dest": "/agent-edit.html" }
{ "src": "/agent/([^/]+)/embed", "dest": "/agent-embed.html" }
{ "src": "/agent/([^/]+)",       "status": 301, "headers": { "Location": "/agents/$1" } }
{ "src": "/a/(\\d+)/(\\d+)",    "dest": "/api/a-page?chain=$1&id=$2" }
{ "src": "/dashboard/?",         "dest": "/dashboard-next/index.html" }
{ "src": "/studio",              "dest": "/studio/index.html" }
```

**Embed routes** (both the `/agents/:id/embed` and legacy `/agent/:id/embed` spellings) include security headers that allow cross-origin iframe embedding:

```json
{
  "src": "/agent/([^/]+)/embed",
  "headers": {
    "content-security-policy": "frame-ancestors *; base-uri 'self'; object-src 'none'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' blob: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com https://unpkg.com https://esm.sh https://ajax.googleapis.com https://s3.tradingview.com https://platform.twitter.com https://3d-agent.vercel.app https://three.ws; worker-src 'self' blob:; report-uri /api/client-errors",
    "x-content-type-options": "nosniff",
    "referrer-policy": "strict-origin-when-cross-origin",
    "permissions-policy": "microphone=(self), camera=(self), xr-spatial-tracking=*",
    "cross-origin-resource-policy": "cross-origin"
  },
  "dest": "/agent-embed.html"
}
```

**Versioned CDN routes** for the web component library serve immutable assets with long cache TTLs:

```json
{
  "src": "/agent-3d/([0-9]+\\.[0-9]+\\.[0-9]+(?:-[A-Za-z0-9.-]+)?)/(.*)",
  "headers": { "cache-control": "public, max-age=31536000, immutable" },
  "dest": "/agent-3d/$1/$2"
}
```

These routes also send `access-control-allow-origin: *` and `cross-origin-resource-policy: cross-origin` so any site can load the bundle. The moving channels (`latest`, a major like `1`, or a minor like `1.5`) get a short cache instead (`max-age=3600, s-maxage=300`). A miss under a version path (one that has not been released yet) answers 404 without the immutable policy, so a CDN edge does not keep serving that 404 after the version is cut. The UMD build (`agent-3d.umd.cjs`) is served as `text/javascript`, so it runs from a plain `<script>` tag.

**Cron jobs** are declared here as the source of truth for the schedule. Read the `crons` array itself for the current set rather than trusting a count quoted in prose. In production they are driven by **Google Cloud Scheduler**, each job hitting its `/api/cron/*` handler on the Cloud Run service:

```json
"crons": [
  { "path": "/api/cron/erc8004-crawl",      "schedule": "*/15 * * * *" },
  { "path": "/api/cron/index-delegations",  "schedule": "*/5 * * * *" },
  { "path": "/api/cron/run-dca",            "schedule": "0 * * * *" },
  { "path": "/api/cron/run-subscriptions",  "schedule": "0 * * * *" }
]
```

These only run against the production deployment (Cloud Scheduler → Cloud Run), not locally. A cron added to this array gets its Scheduler job on the next deploy: `npm run deploy:gcp:sync-crons` (part of `npm run deploy:gcp`) creates a job for every declared cron that has none and never touches existing jobs. See [docs/ops/gcp-production.md](ops/gcp-production.md) for how the Scheduler jobs are provisioned.

---

## `vite.config.js`

The build is controlled by the `TARGET` environment variable:

| Command | `TARGET` | Output | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `npm run build` | `app` (default) | `dist/` | Full multi-page SPA |
| `npm run build:lib` | `lib` | `dist-lib/` | Self-contained web component for CDN (ES module only) |
| `npm run build:lib:full` | `lib` | `dist-lib/` | The same bundle in both ES and UMD form (`LIB_FORMATS=es,umd`); this is what `build:gcp` runs |
| `npm run build:all` | both | both | Builds the chat bundle first, then app and lib in parallel |

**App build** (`TARGET=app`) emits many HTML entry points for the multi-page app, sourced from `pages/`:

- `pages/home.html`: marketing/landing
- `pages/app.html`: agent creator
- `pages/agent-edit.html`, `pages/agent-embed.html`: agent pages (`/agent/:id` itself 301-redirects to `/agents/:id`)
- `pages/dashboard-next/`: user dashboard (sub-pages auto-discovered)
- `public/studio/index.html`: widget studio

**Library build** (`TARGET=lib`) emits a self-contained ES module. The UMD bundle is opt-in through `LIB_FORMATS`, which is why the deploy chain runs `npm run build:lib:full` (`TARGET=lib LIB_FORMATS=es,umd`) rather than `build:lib`:

```
dist-lib/agent-3d.js       # ES module (npm run build:lib)
dist-lib/agent-3d.umd.cjs  # UMD, CommonJS-compatible (npm run build:lib:full)
```

Three.js and ethers are bundled (not externalized) so the web component works as a zero-install drop-in embed via `<script type="module">`.

**VitePWA** generates a service worker for the app build. Only `**/*.{ico,woff2}`, `offline.html` and `pwa-icon.svg` (the offline shell) are precached; HTML pages, JS, and CSS are deliberately excluded so deploys take effect immediately. Google Fonts are cached with a `CacheFirst` strategy and a 1-year TTL, and `/api/*` is never intercepted by the service worker.

The dev server includes a rewrite middleware that mirrors the `vercel.json` route patterns, so `http://localhost:3000/agent/my-agent/edit` works the same as in production.

---

## `cors.json`

This file defines the CORS policy for your S3-compatible storage bucket — it is **not** applied to the API server. Apply it to your bucket using the AWS CLI (or equivalent):

```bash
aws s3api put-bucket-cors \
  --bucket 3d-agent-avatars \
  --cors-configuration file://cors.json \
  --endpoint-url https://<account-id>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com
```

The checked-in `cors.json` restricts GET requests to a specific list of origins: `https://three.ws`, the localhost dev origins, and a few existing partner origins:

```json
[
  {
    "method": ["GET"],
    "origin": [
      "https://three.ws",
      "http://localhost:*",
      "https://localhost:*"
    ],
    "responseHeader": ["Content-Type"],
    "maxAgeSeconds": 3600
  }
]
```

**Add your own domain** to the `origin` array before applying. At minimum, `claude.ai` must be included if you want the MCP `render_avatar` tool to fetch GLBs from your bucket inside Claude.

For a fully open public platform where any site can embed agent viewers, set `"origin": ["*"]`.

---

## `.mcp.json`

Configures MCP server connections for Claude Code integration. Claude Code auto-discovers this file from the project root. The checked-in file defines four servers (`meshy`, `3d-agent`, `3d-agent-local`, `atelier`); secrets are never inlined — values use `${VAR}` environment-variable interpolation, resolved from your shell at load time.

The minimal hosted-endpoint entry looks like:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "3d-agent": {
      "url": "https://three.ws/api/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer ${THREE_WS_MCP_TOKEN}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Set `THREE_WS_MCP_TOKEN` in your environment to an API key from your dashboard. For local development, point `url` at `http://localhost:3000/api/mcp`.

**Never commit a real API key** in this file — keep the `${VAR}` interpolation form so the checked-in file stays secret-free.

---

## Production Checklist

Before going live, verify the following:

- [ ] `JWT_SECRET` is generated with `openssl rand -base64 64` (never a short or guessable string)
- [ ] `DATABASE_URL` includes `?sslmode=require`
- [ ] `PUBLIC_APP_ORIGIN` is set to your production domain (no trailing slash)
- [ ] Upstash Redis is configured — rate limiting is per-instance in-memory without it
- [ ] S3 bucket CORS policy is applied with your production domain in the `origin` list
- [ ] All environment variables are set on the **Cloud Run service** (`three-ws-api`), verified with `gcloud run services describe`
- [ ] `AGENT_RELAYER_KEY` is set via the Cloud Run service env vars, not committed to git
- [ ] `.mcp.json` does not contain a real API key if checked into git
- [ ] `JWT_KID` is set so key rotation can be performed without invalidating all sessions
