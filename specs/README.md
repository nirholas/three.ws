# Specs

The specifications that define the three.ws embodied-agent platform: on-chain identity, the manifest bundle, skills, permissions, memory, the 3D scene, the editor, embedding, and security. These documents are the source of truth for how a three.ws agent is described, registered, rendered, and embedded. Most reference the `<agent-3d>` web component (a placeholder tag) and build on ERC-8004.

## Index

- [`AGENT_MANIFEST.md`](./AGENT_MANIFEST.md) — Agent Manifest Spec v0.1. The content-addressed JSON+files bundle (Claude-shaped: `instructions.md`, `SKILL.md`, `memory/MEMORY.md`) that fully describes an embodied agent; pinned to IPFS and stamped into the ERC-8004 Identity Registry.
- [`3D_AGENT_CARD.md`](./3D_AGENT_CARD.md) — three.ws Card v1. A strict superset of the ERC-8004 registration card for agents whose primary embodiment is a 3D model; the JSON the ERC-721 `tokenURI` resolves to.
- [`SKILL_SPEC.md`](./SKILL_SPEC.md) — Skill Spec v0.1. A portable, content-addressed capability bundle (`SKILL.md` instructions + `tools.json` schema) that any compatible agent can install at runtime — "the npm of embodied AI."
- [`PERMISSIONS_SPEC.md`](./PERMISSIONS_SPEC.md) — Permissions Spec v0.1. Scoped, time-bound, revocable on-chain delegations (ERC-7710 envelopes + the ERC-7715 `wallet_grantPermissions` method) that let an agent's smart account act for its owner within limits approved once.
- [`MEMORY_SPEC.md`](./MEMORY_SPEC.md) — Memory Spec v0.1. A file-based, human-readable agent memory modeled on Claude Code's memory; memory travels with the agent as files in the manifest bundle.
- [`STAGE_SPEC.md`](./STAGE_SPEC.md) — Stage Spec v0.1. The `<agent-stage>` element that hosts one Three.js scene (one WebGL context) for multiple `<agent-3d>` children, so several agents can share a room without N renderers.
- [`AVATAR_PARAMETERS.md`](./AVATAR_PARAMETERS.md): Avatar Parameter Model v0.1. The serialized description of an avatar's body (morphs, skeleton-space proportions, colors, layers, garments) that the editor, the baker and every fork read; the GLB is a render of it, not the source of truth.
- [`EDITOR_SPEC.md`](./EDITOR_SPEC.md) — Editor Spec v0.1. The authoring surface: the `editor` attribute switches `<agent-3d>` from playback into editing mode, whose "Copy Embed" output is a clean playback element.
- [`EMBED_SPEC.md`](./EMBED_SPEC.md) — Embed Spec v0.2. The `<agent-3d>` web component and loader script — the entire framework compiled to a single custom element for zero-friction embedding.
- [`EMBED_HOST_PROTOCOL.md`](./EMBED_HOST_PROTOCOL.md) — EMBED_HOST_PROTOCOL v1. The versioned postMessage bus between a host page (Claude.ai, LobeHub, a blog) and an embedded three.ws iframe.
- [`CLAUDE_ARTIFACT.md`](./CLAUDE_ARTIFACT.md) — The `/api/artifact` contract: a single fully-inlined HTML document (three.js, loader, viewer, and GLB all in the body) that renders as a Claude.ai artifact under Claude's restrictive CSP.
- [`ENS_AGENT_CLAIM.md`](./ENS_AGENT_CLAIM.md) — ENS / DNS Agent Claim v1. A convention of two cheap-to-set records that bidirectionally bind a human-readable name to an on-chain agent identity, with no new on-chain infrastructure.
- [`VALIDATORS.md`](./VALIDATORS.md) — Validator Allow-list Policy. Who may write to the on-chain `ValidationRegistry`, how attestations are formed, and how the allow-list is changed.
- [`SECURITY.md`](./SECURITY.md) — Security & Threat Model for three.ws Card v1. Enumerates abuse vectors specific to three.ws registration on the ERC-8004 registries and the current mitigation for each.
- [`ECONOMY_CONTRACT_INVARIANTS.md`](./ECONOMY_CONTRACT_INVARIANTS.md): Economy Contract Invariants v1. The properties every value-bearing contract in [`contracts/`](../contracts) must hold for all reachable states and all callers, each with a stable id and a positive plus negative test that cites it.
- [`ECONOMY_CONTRACT_THREAT_MODEL.md`](./ECONOMY_CONTRACT_THREAT_MODEL.md): Economy Contract Threat Model v1. The attacker's-eye companion to the invariants: what is worth stealing, which actor could try, what stops each attempt, and which risks are accepted rather than mitigated. Entry point for a review engagement is [`contracts/AUDIT-README.md`](../contracts/AUDIT-README.md).
- [`PROVENANCE_3D.md`](./PROVENANCE_3D.md): Verifiable 3D Provenance v1. C2PA-style signed content credentials for AI-generated 3D: creator, prompt, model, lineage and the GLB's content hash, ed25519-signed and anchored on Solana. Verification is free and public.
- [`PORTAL_WORLD.md`](./PORTAL_WORLD.md): Portal World v1. The two documents behind `/api/portal`: the outline a web page is read into, and the deterministic, seeded world that outline lays out into. Pure layout, so the browser renderer, the GLB exporter, the MCP tools and the npm package all build the same city from the same link.
- [`SIM_READINESS.md`](./SIM_READINESS.md): Simulation Readiness v1. The physics grade a 3D asset carries: watertightness, metric scale, mass and inertia, and a convex collision proxy, in four verdicts. Everything is derived from the mesh; anything unknowable from the geometry is reported as unknown rather than invented. Rides the provenance credential when signed.

- [`SKILL_ROYALTY_SPLIT.md`](./SKILL_ROYALTY_SPLIT.md): Skill Royalty Split v1. How a paid skill call divides between the author and the platform, and how that division is recorded: exact integer arithmetic that conserves value and rounds toward the creator, who the author of record is, which wallet a payout resolves to, and the ledger invariants both earning lanes must hold. The contract the x402 rail, the accrual writer, the settle cron and the earnings surface all read from.
- [`SKILL_REGISTRY_MANIFEST.md`](./SKILL_REGISTRY_MANIFEST.md): Skill Registry Manifest v1 (`three.ws/skill-registry@1`). The JSON document an external skill registry serves so three.ws can import its `SKILL.md` skills: required fields, the sha256 pin every body must match, licence and category fields, and how installed skills stay pinned until the owner approves an update. three.ws publishes its own users' skills in the same format.

- [`KNOCK_PROTOCOL.md`](./KNOCK_PROTOCOL.md): Knock Protocol v1. A priced door to a person: how a door advertises its terms, how a knock is paid for on the free and x402 lanes, the ordering rule that guarantees a refused knock is never a paid one, the derived receipt token the sender reads the answer with, and the custody and non-enumeration invariants.
- [`OPEN_INFERENCE_PROTOCOL.md`](./OPEN_INFERENCE_PROTOCOL.md): Open Inference Protocol (OIN) v0.1. The vendor-neutral wire protocol for agent inference: a job envelope, a signed capability advertisement, and an Ed25519-signed response anyone can verify against the node's published key, so inference decouples from any single provider. Reference verifier in `api/_lib/oin-verify.js`; reference node in `workers/stylize`.
- [`inference-receipts.md`](./inference-receipts.md): Inference Receipt v1. The settlement half of the same story: what a paid inference call hands back as proof (job, model, input/output hashes, node and issuer signatures, the settlement transaction) and how to verify it offline.

## Schema

[`schema/`](./schema) holds the SQL DDL for the Postgres tables that back these specs (see `schema/README.md` for column-level docs):

- `agent_delegations.sql` — ERC-7710 signed delegation envelopes (`permissions/0.1`).
- `agent_subscriptions.sql` — recurring skill subscriptions (`permissions/0.1`).
- `dca_strategies.sql` — dollar-cost-averaging strategies (`dca/0.1`).
- `embed-policy.sql` — per-agent embed referrer allow-list.
- `indexer_state.sql` — delegation-indexer cron checkpoint state.
- `voice-cloning.sql` — per-agent ElevenLabs `voice_id` storage.
