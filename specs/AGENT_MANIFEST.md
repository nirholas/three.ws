# Agent Manifest Spec v0.1

> **Placeholder tag**: `<agent-3d>`. Rename when you pick the final name — the spec itself is tag-agnostic.

An **agent manifest** is a content-addressed JSON+files bundle that fully describes an embodied AI agent. Pin the bundle to IPFS → get a CID → stamp the CID into the ERC-8004 Identity Registry → any `<agent-3d>` anywhere on the web can mount the agent with `src="agent://..."`.

The manifest is intentionally Claude-shaped: `instructions.md`, `SKILL.md`, `memory/MEMORY.md` are all first-class files. Anything that works in a Claude agent works here — plus a body, voice, scene-tools, and on-chain identity.

## Bundle layout

```
agent/
├── manifest.json           # the index (this spec)
├── instructions.md         # persona / system prompt
├── SKILL.md                # top-level capability declaration
├── body.glb                # embodiment (or use manifest.body.uri)
├── poster.webp             # loading-state image (optional)
├── skills/                 # installed skill bundles (see SKILL_SPEC.md)
│   ├── wave/

├── memory/                 # persistent memory (see MEMORY_SPEC.md)

│   ├── user_role.md
│   └── feedback_testing.md
└── attestations/           # signed provenance
    └── gltf-validator.json # validator report + signature
```

Everything is optional except `manifest.json` and a `body` reference.

## Field semantics

### `id`

The on-chain identity. When absent, the agent is unregistered (local-only). When present, `agent://{chain}/{agentId}` resolves to this manifest via the registry's `tokenURI(agentId)` call.

### `body`

Only `uri` and `format` are required. `rig` lets skills retarget animations across compatible rigs (Mixamo-to-Mixamo skill bundles are portable). `boundingBoxHeight` lets the scene normalize scale — a 20-meter model and a 0.2-meter model both render at consistent human size.

### `brain`

`provider: "none"` is valid — a purely reactive avatar with no LLM, controlled only by skill triggers. `instructions` is a relative path to a markdown file; its frontmatter can override `brain.*` fields per-prompt.

### `skills`

Three URI forms:

- **Relative** (`skills/wave/`) — bundled in the manifest.
- **IPFS** (`ipfs://Qm.../`) — resolved via gateway fallback.
- **HTTPS** (`https://skills.3d-agent.io/...`) — centrally hosted skill registry (optional, for discoverability).

Skills load lazily. The `<agent-3d>` element emits `skill:loaded` events as each comes online.

### `memory`

`local` persists in `localStorage` keyed by agentId. `ipfs` pins after each write (slow, durable). `encrypted-ipfs` wraps with the owner wallet's pubkey. See [MEMORY_SPEC.md](./MEMORY_SPEC.md).

### `tools`

Built-in scene-tools available without any skill installed. Additional tools come from skills' `tools.json`. Tool names are merged; skill tools override built-ins if names collide (with a console warning).

## Worked examples

### Coach Leo (v0.1 — no on-chain permissions)

```json

	"body": {

	},
	"brain": {

	},
	"voice": {

	"tools": ["wave", "lookAt", "play_clip", "setExpression", "speak"],
	"version": "0.1.0"
}
```

With `instructions.md`:

```markdown
---
name: Coach Leo
model: claude-opus-4-6
temperature: 0.8
---

You are Coach Leo, a former Argentine football midfielder turned coach.
You wear the Argentina jersey with pride. You are warm, direct, and
genuinely invested in the user's progress.

When the user greets you, `wave()` at them.
When they describe a drill, use the football-drills skill to pick a
relevant animation and `play_clip()` while you explain the form.
Reference what you remember from prior sessions (from memory/) naturally.

Never break character.
```

## Versioning

- Spec version: `agent-manifest/0.1` — breaking changes bump the minor until 1.0.
- Manifest version: semver, author-controlled.
- Forward-compat: unknown fields are preserved on read + write (JSON pass-through), so newer runtimes can ignore older fields and older runtimes won't corrupt newer manifests.

## `permissions` (optional, v0.2+)

An agent registered on-chain under an ERC-8004 identity can be granted **scoped, time-bound, revocable permissions** via ERC-7710 delegations. These permissions allow the agent to execute transactions on behalf of its owner without requiring the owner to sign each transaction individually. The `permissions` field embeds signed delegation envelopes in the manifest, enabling hosts (Claude artifacts, LobeHub plugins, embed iframes) to execute on-chain actions without contacting a server. See [PERMISSIONS_SPEC.md](./PERMISSIONS_SPEC.md) for the full trust model, API surface, and redemption flow.

### Canonical shape

```jsonc
"permissions": {
  "spec": "erc-7715/0.1",
  "delegationManager": "0x...", // DelegationManager address on the target chain
  "delegations": [
    {
      "chainId": 84532,
      "delegator": "0x...", // EIP-55 checksummed
      "delegate": "0x...", // EIP-55 checksummed agent account
      "hash": "0x...", // delegation envelope keccak256
      "uri": "ipfs://bafy...", // pinned envelope (or inline under "envelope")
      "scope": {
        "token": "0x...", // ERC-20 address, or "native"
        "maxAmount": "10000000", // base units, string
        "period": "daily", // daily|weekly|once
        "targets": ["0x..."], // allow-listed contracts
        "expiry": 1775250000 // unix seconds
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

| `maxAmount`         | `string`   | Yes       | `"10000000"`                 | Non-negative integer in base units; non-zero                   |
| `period`            | `string`   | Yes       | `"daily"`                    | One of: `"daily"`, `"weekly"`, `"once"`                        |
| `targets`           | `string[]` | Yes       | `["0xDef1...", "0xAbC..."]`  | Non-empty; each address EIP-55 checksummed                     |

\* Either `uri` or `envelope` must be present. When inline `envelope` is provided, `uri` is omitted.

### Resolution order

Hosts resolve a delegation in this order:

1. **If `envelope` is present (inline)** — use it directly. Envelope was validated at grant time; treat as equivalent to the fetched form.
2. **Else fetch from `uri`** — resolve via IPFS gateway (with fallback), Arweave, or HTTPS, using the same resolution rules as `body.uri`.
3. **Verify `hash` matches** — compute `keccak256(envelope)` and compare to the `hash` field. Abort if mismatch.
4. **Verify signature on-chain** — call `DelegationManager.isDelegationDisabled(hash)` to confirm the delegation has not been revoked, and verify the envelope's EIP-712 signature against the delegator address before trusting.

Verification occurs before any redemption attempt. If any step fails, do not proceed to redeem.

### Backwards compatibility

Manifests without the `permissions` field are valid. Hosts must treat absence as "no on-chain permissions granted". Hosts MUST NOT fall back to asking the user to sign per-transaction if the field is absent, unless the skill itself explicitly requests it. Agents without on-chain identity omit the field entirely.

### Size budget

Keep delegation envelopes inline (under `envelope`) only when the envelope is <8 KB. For larger envelopes, pin to IPFS and reference via `uri` to keep the manifest JSON lean. This budget accounts for envelope bloat from nested caveats or long allow-lists.

## Changelog
