# OKX Agent Payments Protocol: Seller-Side Contract (three.ws A2MCP)

*Historical record, this Work Order research contract was captured 2026-07-06 and reconciled 2026-07-07, the day three.ws production migrated from Vercel to Google Cloud Run. Its "Set in Vercel" / "not set in Vercel production" notes describe that point-in-time state; production env vars now live on the Cloud Run service `three-ws-api` (`gcloud run services describe/update three-ws-api --region us-central1`, see [docs/ops/gcp-production.md](../docs/ops/gcp-production.md)). The seller-side wire contract (§1) and the spec→code map (§5) remain current.*

> **Status:** Research complete. Green-light for Work Order 02.
> **Chain:** X Layer mainnet, `eip155:196` (chainId 196).
> **Our payTo (live):** `0x4022de2D36C334E73C7a108805Cea11C0564f402`, re-probed against production 2026-08-01. The older `0x75d00a2713565171f33216e5aa2a375e076ecf69` appears throughout the body of this spec as the payTo; that is historical, see the 2026-07-23 correction note below. `0x75d0…cf69` is still agent #2632's identity-owner wallet and the buyer/TEE wallet, just not the payment recipient.
> **Fee token:** USD₮0 `0x779Ded0c9e1022225f8E0630b35a9b54bE713736` (6 decimals, EIP-3009).
> **Why this exists:** Our A2MCP endpoint ([api/mcp-3d.js](../api/mcp-3d.js)) emits x402 accepts for Solana/Base/BSC/Arbitrum only, never `eip155:196`, never the OKX fee token, and on the paid leg it reads/emits **x402 v1 header names** (`X-PAYMENT`/`x-payment-response`) rather than the **x402 v2** names OKX uses (`PAYMENT-SIGNATURE`/`PAYMENT-RESPONSE`). That is the exact reason agent #2632 was rejected on 2026-07-04. (The HTTP-level 402 gate itself ALREADY exists, see the verification note below.) This spec pins the seller-side contract from **primary sources** so 02 can implement it without opening a browser.
>
> **Header-naming premise correction (important):** `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE` (buyer→seller) and `PAYMENT-RESPONSE` (seller→buyer) are the **vanilla x402 _v2_ standard** header names (Coinbase `x402` `specs/transports-v2/http.md`; `specs/x402-specification-v2.md:77` literally errors `"PAYMENT-SIGNATURE header is required"`). `X-PAYMENT`/`X-PAYMENT-RESPONSE` are **x402 _v1_**. OKX matches x402 v2 exactly on header naming. (The OKX SDK's `extractPayment` reads ONLY `payment-signature` and the subscription `app-payment`, there is NO v1 `x-payment` fallback in it; SDK-REPO `x402HTTPResourceServer.ts:1558-1580`. Do not rely on v1 names on the OKX rail.) The genuine OKX extensions are only: the `aggr_deferred`/`upto` schemes, the HMAC-signed OKX-hosted facilitator, `syncSettle`, `settle/status`, subscriptions, and the parallel `WWW-Authenticate: Payment` MPP rail. **Our own code labels itself "v2" but uses the v1 payment-header names, that is the delta to close for the X-Layer rail.**
>
> **Verification pass (2026-07-06, second session, independent captures, Appendix H):** a parallel WO-01 run re-derived this contract from its own wire captures (Predexon #2143 as a fourth approved seller, a second signed payment leg, on-chain RPC reads, live `x402-check` runs). It CONFIRMS every §2 answer with two corrections, applied inline below: (1) our endpoint's **HTTP-level 402 gate already exists** for non-MCP clients, bare `POST tools/call` returns `HTTP/2 402` + `PAYMENT-REQUIRED`, and `onchainos agent x402-check --endpoint https://three.ws/api/mcp-3d` parses it `valid: true` (Solana-only accepts, the gap is the missing `eip155:196` entry, not a missing gate; original Q6/G9 overstated this); (2) the SDK has no v1 `x-payment` fallback (above). It also STRENGTHENS Q3: `extra.name`/`extra.version` are now cryptographically pinned against the token's on-chain `DOMAIN_SEPARATOR()` (Appendix H.3).

> **Post-implementation reconciliation (2026-07-07, WO-01 close-out session):** the contract below has since been **implemented** by WO-02/03 and **re-validated against still-live primary sources today**, the approved-seller 402 (oklink `get_chain_info`) is byte-identical to Appendix A, the OKX facilitator still returns `HTTP 401 code 50103` requiring `OK-ACCESS-KEY`, and USD₮0 is unchanged. Spec-vs-shipped conformance was checked: [`api/_lib/x402-xlayer-okx.js`](../api/_lib/x402-xlayer-okx.js) `okxXLayerAccept()` byte-matches §1.1 (scheme `exact`, `eip155:196`, USD₮0 asset, `extra{name:"USD₮0",version:"1",transferMethod:"eip3009",decimals:6}`, `maxTimeoutSeconds:86400`), reads `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE`, routes verify/settle through `OKXFacilitatorClient`, and emits `PAYMENT-RESPONSE` per §1.2. **The §4 gap list below is therefore historical, it was 02's work list and is now closed in code**, EXCEPT the runtime is still gated: the X Layer accept is only advertised when `xlayerSettleable()` is true (`X402_PAY_TO_XLAYER` + `X402_ASSET_ADDRESS_XLAYER` + OKX HMAC creds **or** `X402_XLAYER_RELAYER_KEY`). Those env vars were **not set in Vercel production** on the day this note was written, so `POST /api/okx/3d/*` then returned a **Solana-only** challenge with no `eip155:196` entry. **That runtime gate is CLOSED and has been since the Cloud Run migration.** Re-verified 2026-08-01 against live production: all 9 paid services return a spec-valid 402 whose `accepts[0]` is the `eip155:196` USD₮0 entry at exactly the catalog amount, and `/api/okx/3d/health` reports `payment-rail settleable: true`. The only thing still outstanding from this spec's perspective is funding the buyer wallet for a first settled payment; no code or research remains.

> **Note (2026-09-02, WO-07 audit): the last v1 string is gone.** The header *reading* has accepted `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE` since WO-02, and `PAYMENT-RESPONSE` has always been emitted, so §1.2 held. What did not: the 402 body's `error` field still read `"X-PAYMENT header is required"`, the platform-wide default from [api/_lib/x402-spec.js](../api/_lib/x402-spec.js), on every OKX row including the four listed forge services. A reviewer of an x402-**v2** listing read a **v1** header name in the one string an unpaid call is guaranteed to surface. Closed by `X402_HEADER_ERROR` in [api/_lib/x402-xlayer-okx.js](../api/_lib/x402-xlayer-okx.js), threaded into every OKX challenge, naming both headers with v2 first; the shared default is unchanged for the Solana and Base rails, which really do read `X-PAYMENT`. Pinned by [tests/api/okx-402-dialect.test.js](../tests/api/okx-402-dialect.test.js). Ships on the next deploy.

> **Correction (2026-07-23, Work Order 07 final audit):** the "our payTo" address stated throughout this spec, `0x75d00a2713565171f33216e5aa2a375e076ecf69`, is **no longer what production advertises**. Live probe of `POST /api/okx/3d/text-to-3d` today returns `accepts[0].payTo = 0x4022de2D36C334E73C7a108805Cea11C0564f402` on `eip155:196` (confirmed against the Cloud Run service's live `X402_PAY_TO_XLAYER` env var). That address is the platform's standing EVM merchant/deployer wallet, already the `payTo` for the Base rail (see `contracts/DEPLOYMENTS.md`) and now consolidated onto X Layer too, sometime between 2026-07-07 and 2026-07-23 (no PROGRESS.md entry recorded the change; not a WO-07 regression). `0x75d0…cf69` remains agent #2632's **on-chain identity owner wallet** (the ERC-8004 registration) and the **onchainos buyer/TEE wallet** used to sign test payments, those roles are unaffected, only the payment-recipient address changed. Funding instructions in [`prompts/finish/_context/okx-ai-RUNBOOK.md`](../prompts/finish/_context/okx-ai-RUNBOOK.md) have been corrected to the live address; every `0x75d0…cf69`-as-payTo reference below (§1 examples, Appendix D, the table in §5) is now historical evidence of what was true on the date it was captured, not the current live value. Re-verify `payTo` live before any future funding request.

This is a load-bearing contract in the sense of `specs/README.md`: 02's implementation is validated against §1 (the challenge shape) and §4 (the gap list). Every claim carries a citation. Anything not verifiable from a primary source is marked **UNRESOLVED**.

## 1. Seller contract, what OUR endpoint must emit

### 1.1 The 402 challenge (concrete, with our values)

On an unpaid request to a paid A2MCP resource, respond `HTTP 402` with:

- Header **`PAYMENT-REQUIRED`**: base64 of the JSON body below.
- Header **`Access-Control-Expose-Headers: PAYMENT-REQUIRED`** (so browser/agent clients behind CORS can read it, WIRE-OKLINK sets this).
- Body: the same JSON (SDK emits the challenge in both the header and, on the resource server, the body).

```json
{
  "x402Version": 2,
  "resource": {
    "url": "https://three.ws/api/mcp-3d",
    "mimeType": "application/json"
  },
  "accepts": [
    {
      "scheme": "exact",
      "network": "eip155:196",
      "amount": "15",
      "payTo": "0x75d00a2713565171f33216e5aa2a375e076ecf69",
      "maxTimeoutSeconds": 86400,
      "asset": "0x779ded0c9e1022225f8e0630b35a9b54be713736",
      "extra": { "name": "USD₮0", "version": "1", "symbol": "USDT", "transferMethod": "eip3009" }
    },
    {
      "scheme": "aggr_deferred",
      "network": "eip155:196",
      "amount": "15",
      "payTo": "0x75d00a2713565171f33216e5aa2a375e076ecf69",
      "maxTimeoutSeconds": 86400,
      "asset": "0x779ded0c9e1022225f8e0630b35a9b54be713736",
      "extra": { "name": "USD₮0", "version": "1", "symbol": "USDT", "transferMethod": "eip3009" }
    }
  ]
}
```

`amount` is atomic units of USD₮0 (6 decimals). `"15"` = $0.000015 (the exact price Onchain Data Explorer charges for `get_chain_info`; WIRE-OKLINK). Set per-service in 03.

**Field requirement matrix** (present in ALL three approved sellers ⇒ required; present in some ⇒ optional). Diff of WIRE-OKLINK ∩ WIRE-COINANK ∩ WIRE-OKB:

| Field | Required? | Value / notes |
|---|---|---|
| `x402Version` | ✅ required | `2` (OKB uses `1`, legacy still accepted, but emit `2`; SDK hardcodes `2`, SDK-REPO `facilitator/OKXFacilitatorClient.ts:98`). |
| `accepts[].scheme` | ✅ required | `"exact"` present in all three. `"aggr_deferred"` in 2/3 (optional). `"upto"` in **none**. |
| `accepts[].network` | ✅ required | `"eip155:196"` in all three. **This is the field we don't emit, root cause of rejection.** |
| `accepts[].asset` | ✅ required | `0x779ded…713736` (USD₮0) in all three. |
| `accepts[].payTo` | ✅ required | Seller receiving address. Ours: `0x75d00a2713565171f33216e5aa2a375e076ecf69`. |
| `accepts[].amount` (v2) / `maxAmountRequired` (v1) | ✅ required | Atomic USD₮0 string. |
| `accepts[].maxTimeoutSeconds` | ✅ required | Seen `86400` / `300` / `300`. Use `86400` (oklink) or any ≥ a few minutes; it bounds `validBefore`. |
| `accepts[].extra.name` | ✅ required (EIP-3009) | `"USD₮0"`, the token's **EIP-712 domain name**. Must byte-match the on-chain domain separator or the facilitator computes the wrong hash and rejects the signature. |
| `accepts[].extra.version` | ✅ required (EIP-3009) | `"1"`, EIP-712 domain version. |
| `accepts[].extra.symbol` | ⬜ optional | `"USDT"`. Only WIRE-OKLINK emits it. Display hint. |
| `accepts[].extra.transferMethod` | ⬜ optional | `"eip3009"`. Only WIRE-OKLINK emits it. Default is EIP-3009 when absent (SDK `assetTransferMethod` only set for permit2 tokens; `defaultAssets.ts`). |
| `accepts[].extra.decimals` | ⬜ optional | `6`. Only WIRE-OKB (v1) puts it in `extra`; v2 sellers omit it (decimals come from the default-asset registry). |
| `resource.url` | ✅ required | Absolute URL of the paid resource. |
| `resource.mimeType` | ⬜ optional | `"application/json"` (WIRE-OKLINK). WIRE-COINANK omits it. |
| top-level `error` | conditional | Added only on a rejected paid replay (e.g. `"insufficient_balance"`); the full `accepts` is re-emitted so the client can retry. See PAY-LEG2 / Appendix D. |

**Rule: every rejected payment leaves with the quotation attached, an undecodable
`PAYMENT-SIGNATURE` included.** OKX's seller SDK (`@okxweb3/x402-core`,
`x402HTTPResourceServer.extractPayment`) catches a header it cannot base64/JSON-decode, logs
it, and treats the request as unpaid, so the caller gets the ordinary 402 with the full
`accepts` back. Ours used to answer that one case with a bare `HTTP 400
{"error":"invalid_payment"}` and no `accepts` at all. A marketplace validator that replays a
payment reads a response with no `accepts` as "the x402 quotation cannot be parsed", which is
verbatim the internal note on the 2026-09-04 rejection. Only a genuine server fault (5xx) may
answer a paid request without re-emitting the quotation. Implemented in `sendX402Error()`
([api/_mcp/payments.js](../api/_mcp/payments.js)) for the A2MCP rows and in
`handleRestService()` ([api/okx/3d/[service].js](../api/okx/3d/%5Bservice%5D.js)) for the REST
rows; covered by `tests/api/okx-forge.test.js` and `tests/api/okx-3d-services.test.js`.

Notes vs. our current Bazaar-heavy body: OKX sellers emit **no** `extensions.bazaar`, **no** `builder-code`, **no** `offer-receipt`, **no** per-accept `description`. The OKX validator does not require them; keep the body minimal for the `eip155:196` accepts.

### 1.2 Verify → do-work → settle (seller → OKX facilitator)

On a request that carries the payment header, the seller calls the **OKX facilitator** (HMAC-authed, see §Q4) and only does the work after `/verify` passes:

```
1. header = req.header("PAYMENT-SIGNATURE")          // x402 v2 std; also accept v1 `x-payment` for back-compat
2. paymentPayload = JSON.parse(base64url_decode(header))
3. requirement  = the accepts[] entry matching paymentPayload.accepted (network+scheme+asset)
4. POST https://web3.okx.com/api/v6/pay/x402/verify
     headers: OK-ACCESS-KEY / OK-ACCESS-SIGN / OK-ACCESS-TIMESTAMP / OK-ACCESS-PASSPHRASE
     body:    { x402Version: 2, paymentPayload, paymentRequirements: requirement }
   → { code, msg, data: { isValid, invalidReason?, invalidMessage?, payer? } }
   If !isValid → re-emit the 402 with top-level error = invalidReason (see PAY-LEG2).
5. Run the tool / produce the resource body.
6. POST https://web3.okx.com/api/v6/pay/x402/settle   (same auth + body, optional syncSettle)
   → { code, msg, data: { success, status, transaction, network, payer, amount? } }
7. Attach header PAYMENT-RESPONSE = base64(JSON.stringify(settleResponse)) to the 200.
```

Live-confirmed by PAY-LEG1/2.

### 1.2a Signature check order: recover first, ERC-1271 second (EIP-7702 buyers)

**Every OKX agentic wallet on X Layer is an EIP-7702 delegated EOA**, not a plain EOA and not
a deployed smart account. `eth_getCode` on one returns the 23-byte delegation designator
`0xef0100 || implementation`: verified 2026-09-04 for the OKX audit test address
`0xbc59eb75C55e3bF1E63aaeE653C2b8E02BFd2033` (delegate `0xe40ccb2d…96fa4`, holding 19.550213
USD₮0) and for our own buyer `0x75d0…cf69`.

That makes verification-by-contract-call wrong for this rail. A seller that hands the
authorization to a generic "is this signature valid for this address" helper (viem's
`verifyTypedData`, ethers' `isValidSignature` wrappers) gets the **contract** branch, because
the address has code: the helper calls the delegate's ERC-1271 `isValidSignature`, the
delegate answers over its own replay-safe wrapper hash rather than the raw EIP-712 digest,
and the check returns `false` for a signature the wallet's own key produced correctly.

The token does not judge it that way, and the token is the authority: USD₮0's
`transferWithAuthorization` recovers the ECDSA signature first (ERC-1271 is only its
fallback). Proven read-only against mainnet on 2026-09-04 by simulating the redemption with
a state-overridden delegated signer: **accepted, no revert**, identical to a plain EOA.

**Rule: recover the EIP-712 signature and compare to `authorization.from` FIRST; only when
recovery cannot name the payer (a real smart account, an ERC-6492 wrapper) fall back to the
on-chain ERC-1271/6492 check.** Implemented in `eip3009SignatureIsValid()`
([x402-xlayer-okx.js](../api/_lib/x402-xlayer-okx.js)), covered by
`tests/api/okx-xlayer-verify.test.js`.

**Wire evidence (why this is not theoretical).** OKX's listing QA ran against production on
2026-08-27T00:53:47Z-00:53:58Z from `Java-http-client/17.0.8.1` (8.212.100.234 /
8.212.101.240), two POSTs per paid row: an unpaid probe (402, ~480-680 B request) then a
signed replay (~1.6-1.8 kB request, i.e. the `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE` header). Every replay was
answered **402 again**, 0.40-0.71 s of RPC latency each, and each response body grew by
exactly the bytes of a 57-character `error` over the unpaid one: the length of
`EIP-3009 signature does not verify for authorization.from`. The 2026-09-04 rejection
("failed the official test, we are unable to verify the availability of your service", plus
the internal note that the flow "has not entered the payment stage") is that rejection,
seen from their side.


### 1.3 The paid-replay header (buyer → seller)

The buyer replays the original request adding **`PAYMENT-SIGNATURE: <base64 PaymentPayload>`**. The decoded payload we must accept (from PAY-LEG1, our real signature):

```json
{
  "x402Version": 2,
  "resource": { "mimeType": "application/json", "url": "https://www.oklink.com/api/v5/explorer/mcp/x402/get_chain_info" },
  "accepted": {
    "scheme": "exact", "network": "eip155:196", "amount": "15",
    "asset": "0x779ded0c9e1022225f8e0630b35a9b54be713736",
    "payTo": "0xa7e37604ebab94408159e405033a455f820fd987",
    "maxTimeoutSeconds": 86400,
    "extra": { "name": "USD₮0", "symbol": "USDT", "transferMethod": "eip3009", "version": "1" }
  },
  "payload": {
    "authorization": {
      "from": "0x75d00a2713565171f33216e5aa2a375e076ecf69",
      "to":   "0xa7e37604ebab94408159e405033a455f820fd987",
      "value": "15", "validAfter": "0", "validBefore": "1783455107",
      "nonce": "0x20ea1abd9c8d9ee9c4e0a861071475061ffebf07076eec8fa6d963f2a8957253"
    },
    "signature": "0x88c64c51…3d37891c"
  }
}
```

The seller passes `payload` + the matching `accepted` (as `paymentRequirements`) straight to the facilitator, it does not re-derive the EIP-712 hash itself. Header name is read case-insensitively (`payment-signature` OR `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE`; SDK `x402HTTPResourceServer.ts:1560`).

### 1.4 Settlement receipt (seller → buyer)

On success attach `PAYMENT-RESPONSE` (base64 of the `SettleResponse`). Shape (SDK `types/facilitator.ts:26-38`):

```json
{ "success": true, "status": "success", "transaction": "0x…", "network": "eip155:196", "payer": "0x75d0…cf69", "amount": "15" }
```

- `status: "success"` when settled with `syncSettle:true` (facilitator waited for on-chain confirmation).
- `status: "pending"` (default, `syncSettle` unset/false), facilitator accepted, tx settles async; seller may confirm later via `GET /api/v6/pay/x402/settle/status?txHash=…`.
- `status: "timeout"`, on-chain confirmation timed out.

| 4 | OKX facilitator verify/settle URLs, shapes, auth | Base `https://web3.okx.com`. **`POST /api/v6/pay/x402/verify`**, **`POST /api/v6/pay/x402/settle`**, `GET /api/v6/pay/x402/supported`, `GET /api/v6/pay/x402/settle/status?txHash=`. Body `{x402Version:2, paymentPayload, paymentRequirements[, syncSettle]}`. Responses wrapped `{code,msg,data}`. **Auth = OKX REST HMAC-SHA256**: headers `OK-ACCESS-KEY`, `OK-ACCESS-SIGN`(=base64(HMAC-SHA256(secret, timestamp+method+path+body))), `OK-ACCESS-TIMESTAMP`(ISO-8601), `OK-ACCESS-PASSPHRASE`. **⇒ We need an OKX API key/secret/passphrase.** `upto`'s `extra.facilitatorAddress` = `supported.signers[family][0]` via `getExtra()`. | SDK `facilitator/OKXFacilitatorClient.ts` (all endpoints + `createHeaders` L60-76); `upto/facilitator/scheme.ts:39` |
| 5 | The official OKX Payment SDK | **`github.com/okx/payments` = "OKX Payments SDK", Apache-2.0** (monorepo `@okxweb3/payments-sdk-monorepo`; Go/Python/Rust/TS/Java). **Use the `@okxweb3/app-x402-*` family @ v0.2.0** (`-core`, `-evm`, `-express`/`-next`/`-hono`/`-fastify`, `-mpp`), that's what the runnable demo imports (published 2026-07-03). **⚠️ Avoid the stale `@okxweb3/x402-*` @ v0.1.0** (`x402-core`/`x402-evm`/`mpp`) that the repo's `SELLER.md` still names, last touched 2026-06-08. Pure TypeScript (deps `viem`/`zod`/`axios`/`mppx`, pure JS, `@noble` crypto, `node:crypto` HMAC, no native bindings) ⇒ **runs in Vercel functions**. Seller-side it builds the 402 challenge, reads `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE`, calls facilitator verify/settle, emits `PAYMENT-RESPONSE`, plus lifecycle hooks + metered `setSettlementOverrides`. Weekly downloads low (new pkg): app-x402-core ≈267, -evm ≈204, -express ≈188. | SDK-REPO README + `package.json`; `npm view @okxweb3/app-x402-*`; `api.npmjs.org/downloads/point/last-week`; `app-x402-next/README.md` |
| 6 | HTTP-level 402 vs MCP-level PaymentRequired | OKX expects **HTTP-level 402** on the endpoint URL: real `HTTP/2 402` status + `PAYMENT-REQUIRED` header, paid replay via `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE` header. All approved sellers do HTTP-level; the validator/buyer never inspects JSON-RPC `_meta`. **CORRECTED (verification pass): our endpoint ALREADY has this HTTP-level gate**, a bare (non-MCP) `POST tools/call` gets `HTTP/2 402` + `PAYMENT-REQUIRED`, live-verified for `text_to_3d` and `auto_rig_model`, and `x402-check` parses it `valid: true` (Appx H.1). Only MCP-protocol clients (`mcp-protocol-version` header) are routed to 401/OAuth, which OKX tooling never sends. 02's work on this axis is ONLY: the paid-replay leg must also accept `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE` (G7) and emit `PAYMENT-RESPONSE` (G8); the MCP-level `_meta` flow stays for MCP-native clients. | WIRE-OKLINK (POST→402, GET→405); Appx H.1 (live status matrix + x402-check `valid:true`); [api/mcp-3d.js](../api/mcp-3d.js), [api/_mcp/auth.js](../api/_mcp/auth.js); SDK is HTTP-transport only |
| 7 | How listing review validates the endpoint | Two layers. **(a) Registration-time `validate-listing` is PURE-LOCAL, no HTTP probe** (`onchainos-skills` `cli/…/identity/validate.rs`): it only checks A2MCP has an `endpoint`, the URL is `https://` + publicly reachable (rejects `http`, `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, RFC-1918, `*.local/.internal`, mock/placeholder, >512 chars), fee is a plain number (USDT implicit), description has no URLs/addresses. It writes the endpoint URL on-chain (ERC-8004). Service-type → rail: **`A2MCP → x402`**. **(b) Approval / rejection** ("A2MCP service has not been integrated with the OKX Agent Payments Protocol") is a **human/off-repo review**, no codified automated probe that asserts the 402 shape exists in `okx/payments` or `onchainos-skills`. To pass it, the live endpoint must emit a v2 `402` whose `accepts` advertise **`eip155:196` + USD₮0** at the registered price. **Self-check tool (manual, not the gate):** `onchainos agent x402-check --endpoint <url>` flags `"Endpoint returned HTTP 200 (not 402); not a valid x402 service"` when the gate is absent (Appx E). **UNRESOLVED:** the exact method/body of any OKX-side automated probe, and whether one exists, are undocumented (dev-portal pages are JS-rendered / 404 to fetch). 02 should register, run `x402-check` against `https://three.ws/api/mcp-3d`, confirm `valid:true`, then resubmit for (human) review. | `onchainos-skills` `identity/validate.rs`, `task-cli-reference.md:396`; `onchainos agent x402-check` (Appx E); rejection email (00-CONTEXT) |
| 8 | Settlement finality, how seller confirms payment | Seller trusts the facilitator's responses, not its own chain read. `/verify` → `isValid:true` gates doing the work (proves the signed authorization is valid + payer funded, a broke payer gets `isValid:false` / `insufficient_balance`, proven by PAY-LEG2). `/settle` → `{success, status}`: `syncSettle:true` ⇒ `status:"success"` (on-chain confirmed before responding); default async ⇒ `status:"pending"` (safe to release; poll `/settle/status?txHash` for finality). The `PAYMENT-RESPONSE` header carries `{success,status,transaction,payer,amount}` to the buyer. | SDK `OKXFacilitatorClient.ts` settle L124-150 + `syncSettle` docstring; `types/facilitator.ts:26-38`; PAY-LEG2 |

## 3. SDK decision, adopt `@okxweb3/app-x402-*` (with a thin adapter)

**Decision: ADOPT the OKX Payments SDK for the OKX/X-Layer rail; keep our existing `api/_lib/x402-spec.js` for the Solana/Base/BSC rails.** Do not hand-roll the OKX dialect.

Per CLAUDE.md "Open-source first" checklist:

| Criterion | Finding | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| Solves the problem | Yes, builds the exact `eip155:196` challenge, HMAC-signs facilitator calls, handles `exact`/`aggr_deferred`/`upto`/`period`, emits `PAYMENT-RESPONSE`. First-party, so it tracks the spec the validator enforces. | ✅ |
| Maintenance / provenance | Official OKX org (`okx/payments`), the SDK the rejection email points to. Multi-language, actively structured. v0.2.0 (early but first-party). | ✅ |
| License | **Apache-2.0** (`@okxweb3/app-mpp` is MIT). Compatible with our commercial use. | ✅ |
| Vercel compatibility | Pure TS, deps are `fetch` + `node:crypto` + `viem`-class EVM libs; no native addons. `@okxweb3/app-x402-next` targets Next/serverless directly. | ✅ |
| Weekly downloads | Low, app-x402-core ≈267/wk, -evm ≈204, -express ≈188 (v0.2.0, published 2026-07-03). Mitigated by first-party status + our own tests. | ⚠️ acceptable |

**⚠️ Package trap:** install the **`@okxweb3/app-x402-*` v0.2.0** family (what the demo imports), NOT the stale **`@okxweb3/x402-*` v0.1.0** family the repo's `SELLER.md` documents (last touched 2026-06-08).

**Adoption shape for 02:** our endpoint is a bare Vercel function (`api/mcp-3d.js`, Node `req/res`), not a Next.js app-router route, so `withX402` (needs `NextRequest`/`NextResponse`) is not a drop-in. Use the framework-agnostic core: `@okxweb3/app-x402-core` (`x402ResourceServer`, `OKXFacilitatorClient`, the `HTTPAdapter` interface, header codecs) + `@okxweb3/app-x402-evm` (`ExactEvmScheme`). Write a ~30-line `HTTPAdapter` over our Node `req`. This gives the OKX 402/verify/settle for `eip155:196` alongside our current multi-chain `paymentRequirements()` for the other rails. Reference seller wiring: SDK `demo/x402/src/index.ts` (Express) and `app-x402-next/README.md` (`withX402`). **Serverless caveat:** `await resourceServer.initialize()` calls the facilitator `/supported` and must run once per cold start (lazily) before the first paid request, it is what populates `upto`'s `facilitatorAddress` and validates scheme support.

**Env we must add:** `OKX_API_KEY`, `OKX_SECRET_KEY`, `OKX_PASSPHRASE` (facilitator HMAC), plus the payTo already known. **Blocker for 02:** these OKX API credentials must be provisioned by the owner from the OKX Web3 developer console. Without them every `/verify` and `/settle` fails auth. → raised in PROGRESS.

---

## 4. Gap analysis, `paymentRequirements()` today vs. what OKX requires (02's work list)

Reference: [api/_lib/x402-spec.js](../api/_lib/x402-spec.js) `paymentRequirements()` (L162-232) and `buildExactRequirements()` (L362-398).

| # | What we emit today | What OKX requires | Action for 02 |
|---|---|---|---|
| G1 | Accepts for `NETWORK_SOLANA_MAINNET`, `NETWORK_BASE_MAINNET`, `NETWORK_BSC_MAINNET`, `NETWORK_ARBITRUM_MAINNET`. **No `eip155:196`.** | An `accepts` entry with `network:"eip155:196"`. | Add `NETWORK_XLAYER_MAINNET = "eip155:196"` and an X-Layer branch (behind an env like `X402_PAY_TO_XLAYER`). |
| G2 | `asset` = USDC on Solana/Base; `X402_ASSET_ADDRESS_BASE`. | `asset` = `0x779ded0c9e1022225f8e0630b35a9b54be713736` (USD₮0). | Hardcode/env the USD₮0 mint for the X-Layer accept. |
| G3 | `extra: { name, decimals }` (Base) / `{ name, decimals, feePayer }` (Solana). | `extra: { name:"USD₮0", version:"1" }` (+ optional `symbol`,`transferMethod`,`decimals`). **`version` is required.** | New `extra` builder for the X-Layer accept: `name`+`version` mandatory. `decimals: 6` is optional (v2 sellers omit it) but RECOMMENDED: without it `x402-check` emits a `tokenResolveError` ("cannot determine token decimals … does not provide a `decimals` field", Appx H.2) because USD₮0 is outside the task system's supported-token list, harmless for oklink but free to avoid. |
| G4 | Field name `extra.assetTransferMethod` (permit2 path). | OKX exact uses `extra.transferMethod:"eip3009"` (or omit → EIP-3009 default). | Emit `transferMethod` (optional), do NOT emit `assetTransferMethod` on the X-Layer accept. |
| G5 | Schemes `exact` (EIP-3009/permit2) + `direct` (BSC). **No `aggr_deferred`.** | `exact` mandatory; `aggr_deferred` recommended 2nd accept. | Emit `exact` for X-Layer; optionally add `aggr_deferred` accept (SDK `ExactEvmScheme`/aggr scheme). |
| G6 | Facilitator routing = CDP / PayAI / self / BSC-direct (`facilitatorFor()`). **No OKX facilitator.** | verify/settle at `https://web3.okx.com/api/v6/pay/x402/{verify,settle}` with HMAC auth. | Add an `OKXFacilitatorClient` route for `eip155:196` (adopt SDK, §3). |
| G7 | Payment header read = **`X-PAYMENT`** (x402 v1 name; `decodePaymentHeader`, `verifyPayment`), despite the file labeling itself "v2". | Buyer sends **`PAYMENT-SIGNATURE`** (the x402 **v2** standard name). | On the X-Layer path read `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE` (case-insensitive; also accept `x-payment` for v1 back-compat). Keep `X-PAYMENT` for the other rails. |
| G8 | Success receipt = **`x-payment-response`** (x402 v1 name; set in `api/mcp-3d.js:107` etc.). | **`PAYMENT-RESPONSE`** (x402 v2 name). | Emit `PAYMENT-RESPONSE` on the X-Layer success reply. |
| G9 | ~~Gating is MCP-level only~~ **CORRECTED:** HTTP-level 402 + `PAYMENT-REQUIRED` already emitted to non-MCP clients ([api/_mcp/auth.js](../api/_mcp/auth.js) `send402` path; live-verified `HTTP/2 402` on bare `tools/call`, Appx H.1). MCP-protocol clients get 401/OAuth, fine, OKX tooling never sends `mcp-protocol-version`. | **HTTP-level 402** on the endpoint URL, already satisfied. | No new gate. Verify with `x402-check` after G1-G8 land; keep the 401/OAuth branch for MCP clients as-is. |
| G10 | Body carries `extensions.bazaar` + `builder-code` + `offer-receipt`. | OKX sellers emit none of these on the `eip155:196` accepts. | Keep the OKX accept body minimal (`x402Version/resource/accepts`); don't attach Bazaar extensions to it. |
| G11 | Facilitator auth = CDP JWT / bearer token. | OKX HMAC needs `OKX_API_KEY`/`OKX_SECRET_KEY`/`OKX_PASSPHRASE`. | Provision + wire the three env vars (owner blocker). |
| G12 | `maxTimeoutSeconds: 60`. | Approved sellers use `86400`/`300`. | Use ≥ ~300 on X-Layer (bounds `validBefore`); `86400` matches oklink. |

**Non-goals for 02** (explicitly out of scope): the WWW-Authenticate `charge`/`session` MPP rail (CoinAnk offers it, but `exact` alone passes approval) and `period`/subscription. `upto` is unnecessary and adds a Permit2 approve step. Ship `exact` (+ optional `aggr_deferred`) only.

---

## 5. Implementation (Work Order 02, landed 2026-07-07)

The OKX/X Layer rail was implemented as an **addition** to the existing multi-rail
`x402-spec.js` seams, not a parallel payment stack. The `eip155:196` accept, the OKX
facilitator verify/settle route, and the x402-v2 receipt header names all flow through
the same `paymentRequirements()` / `verifyPayment()` / `settlePayment()` /
`encodePaymentResponseHeader()` functions every other rail uses, selected by the network
of the presented payment. Spec → code map (file:line at landing commit `05de055d6`):

| Spec / Gap | Requirement | Code |
|---|---|---|
| §1.1, G1-G5, G12 | The `eip155:196` accept, byte-shaped to the approved-seller wire (`scheme:exact`, USD₮0 asset, `extra.{name,version,symbol,transferMethod,decimals}`, `maxTimeoutSeconds:86400`) | [`okxXLayerAccept()`](../api/_lib/x402-xlayer-okx.js#L190-L210), the domain constants `USDT0_DOMAIN_NAME='USD₮0'` (₮ = U+20AE) / `USDT0_DOMAIN_VERSION='1'` are [pinned + commented](../api/_lib/x402-xlayer-okx.js#L59-L65) against Appx H.3 |
| §1.1 | Advertise the accept only when settlement is actually possible (never 402-then-502) | [`xlayerSettleable()`](../api/_lib/x402-xlayer-okx.js#L179-L185); wired into [`paymentRequirements()`](../api/_lib/x402-spec.js#L239-L246) after the Solana/Base/BSC accepts (multi-rail coexistence, requirement 4) |
| §1.1 amount | Advertised == verified == settled, all from `priceBatch`/`studioX402Amount` (requirement 6) | The X Layer accept takes `common.amount` (the per-tool price) unchanged, USD₮0 shares USDC's 6-decimal atomic scale, so `150000` = $0.15 across every rail. [x402-spec.js#L245](../api/_lib/x402-spec.js#L245) |
| §1.2 step 3, G6 | Route verify/settle to the OKX rail by network | [`facilitatorFor()` → `{okxXLayer:true}`](../api/_lib/x402-spec.js#L287-L292) for `eip155:196` |
| §1.2 step 4, §1.2a, requirement 2 | Verify BEFORE work: EIP-712 ECDSA recovery FIRST, ERC-1271/6492 only as the fallback (§1.2a, EIP-7702 buyers), recipient/amount/time-window checks, unused-nonce + `balanceOf` on-chain, then the OKX facilitator `/verify` when credentialed | [`verifyOkxXLayerPayment()`](../api/_lib/x402-xlayer-okx.js#L272-L416); dispatched from [`verifyPayment()`](../api/_lib/x402-spec.js#L1014-L1022). Invalid/underpaid/expired throws `X402Error` 402 → fresh challenge, tool does not run |
| §1.2 step 6, §1.4, requirement 3 | Settle only after tool success; OKX facilitator `/settle` (`syncSettle:true`) primary, direct EIP-3009 redemption fallback; return `{success,status,transaction,payer,amount}` | [`settleOkxXLayerPayment()`](../api/_lib/x402-xlayer-okx.js#L442-L530); dispatched from [`settlePayment()`](../api/_lib/x402-spec.js#L1110-L1120). Called only after `anySuccess` in [mcp-3d.js](../api/mcp-3d.js#L103-L119) and [okx/3d/[service].js](../api/okx/3d/%5Bservice%5D.js#L377-L392) |
| §1.3, G7 | Read the buyer's `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE` (x402 v2) header; parse the OKX `{accepted, payload:{authorization,signature}}` dialect | [auth.js reads `payment-signature`](../api/_mcp/auth.js#L94-L97); [`selectRequirement()` matches `paymentPayload.accepted.network`](../api/_lib/x402-spec.js#L786-L792); [`extractAuthorization()`](../api/_lib/x402-xlayer-okx.js#L237-L249) |
| §1.4, G8 | Emit `PAYMENT-RESPONSE` (x402 v2) receipt with `status`+`amount`; keep `x-payment-response` (v1) as an alias | [`encodePaymentResponseHeader()`](../api/_lib/x402-spec.js#L1169-L1186) now passes through `status`/`amount`; both header names set in [mcp-3d.js#L108-L116](../api/mcp-3d.js#L108-L116) and [service].js; both added to the [CORS expose list](../api/_lib/http.js#L383-L386) |
| §Q4/§Q5, G6/G11 | OKX facilitator client (HMAC-SHA256 auth) | Adopt the official SDK [`OKXFacilitatorClient` from `@okxweb3/app-x402-core@^0.2.0`](../api/_lib/x402-xlayer-okx.js#L51) behind our seams (SDK decision §3), no hand-rolled dialect |
| G9 | HTTP-level 402 gate | Already present (Appx H.1); unchanged. The `send402`/`sendAuthChallenge` non-MCP branch emits the challenge to bare `tools/call` |
| G10 | Keep the OKX accept minimal | The X Layer accept carries no per-accept Bazaar extension; `sendOkx402()` ([x402-xlayer-okx.js#L218-L232](../api/_lib/x402-xlayer-okx.js#L218-L232)) emits the minimal `{x402Version,resource,accepts}` for the decomposed `/api/okx/3d/*` services. (The `/api/mcp-3d` MCP endpoint keeps its Bazaar body for its non-OKX discovery role; the X Layer accept inside it is still minimal.) |

**Config / env (all through `api/_lib/env.js`, never hardcoded):**

| Var | Purpose | Set in Vercel? |
|---|---|---|
| `X402_PAY_TO_XLAYER` | Seller receiving address on X Layer | ✅ set in production. Value as of 2026-07-07: `0x75d0…cf69`. **Value live 2026-07-23 (WO-07 audit): `0x4022de2D…f402`, the platform's standard EVM merchant wallet**, see the 2026-07-23 correction note above. |
| `X402_ASSET_ADDRESS_XLAYER` | USD₮0 mint; defaults to `0x779ded…713736` in [env.js](../api/_lib/env.js#L752-L754) so it needs no explicit set | default |
| `X402_XLAYER_RELAYER_KEY` | Relayer key for the direct-redemption settle fallback (no OKX creds) | ✅ Preview + Production |
| `OKX_API_KEY` / `OKX_SECRET_KEY` / `OKX_PASSPHRASE` | OKX facilitator HMAC, enables the official `/verify`+`/settle` route | ❌ **owner action** (see PROGRESS) |

With `X402_PAY_TO_XLAYER` + `X402_XLAYER_RELAYER_KEY` set, `xlayerSettleable()` is true and the rail is advertised and settleable via direct redemption today. The OKX facilitator creds are the preferred settle route (gasless, first-party) and remain the one owner blocker for WO-04's funded run.

**Verification captured this session (local, real module over `node:http`):** unpaid `POST tools/call text_to_3d` → `HTTP/1.1 402` whose `accepts[1]` is the `eip155:196` USD₮0 entry with every §1.1 field byte-exact (`extra.name` bytes = `555344e282ae30`, confirmed). `onchainos payment pay --selected-index 1` ACCEPTED it and returned a `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE` header signing `value:"150000"` to our payTo on `eip155:196`. Replaying that header against our endpoint (wallet holds 0 USD₮0) ran the real on-chain verify and returned `402 error:"insufficient_balance"` with a fresh full challenge, the tool did not run. Field-validated captures in `prompts/okx-ai/e2e-evidence/`.

 { "…second-stablecoin aggr_deferred accept, identifiers omitted…" },
 {"x402Version":2,"scheme":"aggr_deferred","network":"eip155:196","amount":"1000","asset":"0x779ded0c9e1022225f8e0630b35a9b54be713736","payTo":"0xb1257e75791baa36646113d8b1fdfc83b3e2d0b7","maxTimeoutSeconds":300,"extra":{"name":"USD₮0","version":"1"}}],
 "resource":{"url":"https://open-api.coinank.com/api/etf/getUsBtcEtf"}}
```

Structural takeaways (same across both currencies): each accept nests its own `x402Version:2`; `extra` is `{name, version}` only (no `symbol`/`transferMethod`/`decimals`); `resource` is `{url}` with no `mimeType`.

`WWW-Authenticate` charge `request` (USD₮0) decoded: `{"amount":"1000","currency":"0x779ded…713736","recipient":"0xb1257e…d0b7","methodDetails":{"chainId":196,"feePayer":true}}`.
Session `request` decoded: adds `"escrowContract":"0x5E550002e64FaF79B41D89fE8439eEb1be66CE3b","minVoucherDelta":"10000"` and `"suggestedDeposit":"100000"`. (MPP rail, out of scope for 02.)

### C. WIRE-OKB, OKB Monitoring #3837, `/x402/digest`

Both `GET` and `POST` → `HTTP/2 402`, body (note **`x402Version:1`**, `maxAmountRequired`, per-accept `decimals`/`description`):

```json
{"x402Version":1,"accepts":[{"scheme":"exact","network":"eip155:196","asset":"0x779ded0c9e1022225f8e0630b35a9b54be713736","decimals":6,"maxAmountRequired":"10000","payTo":"0x0921f7fcbc93984c2a4d29b4079f97840184365b","resource":"https://okb.swaper.money/x402/digest","description":"OKB X Layer monitor, OKB X Layer daily anomaly digest (alerts + metrics + report)","mimeType":"application/json","maxTimeoutSeconds":300,"extra":{"name":"USD₮0","version":"1"}}]}
```

### D. PAY-LEG1/2, real payment from our wallet `0x75d0…cf69`

**Leg 1**, `onchainos payment pay --payload <oklink 402> --selected-index 0` →
`{ok:true, data:{ header_name:"PAYMENT-SIGNATURE", scheme:"exact", wallet:"0x75d00a2713565171f33216e5aa2a375e076ecf69", authorization_header:"<base64>" }}`. Decoded payload in §1.3 (EIP-3009 `transferWithAuthorization`, value "15", from our wallet, to oklink's payTo, signed).

**Leg 2**, replay `POST get_chain_info` with `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE: <header>` → `HTTP/2 402`, body:

```json
{"x402Version":2,"error":"insufficient_balance","resource":{"url":"https://www.oklink.com/api/v5/explorer/mcp/x402/get_chain_info","mimeType":"application/json"},"accepts":[ …same two accepts as Appx A… ]}
```

**Interpretation:** signing succeeded (leg 1 real), and the seller's facilitator did an on-chain balance check and rejected because our X-Layer wallet holds **0 USD₮0**, proving (a) the seller→facilitator verify path is live, (b) rejection re-emits the full 402 with a top-level `error`. **Funding blocker (DoD):** to capture a fully-successful paid leg the owner must fund `0x75d00a2713565171f33216e5aa2a375e076ecf69` on **X Layer (chainId 196)** with **USD₮0** (`0x779ded…713736`). Minimum to pay oklink `get_chain_info` = **15 atomic (0.000015 USD₮0)**; recommend **~1.0 USD₮0 (1,000,000 atomic)** for buffer across test calls + the pfp-wedge work. `exact`+EIP-3009 is gasless for the payer (facilitator broadcasts, `feePayer:true`), so no OKB gas is strictly required; a small OKB dust (~0.5 OKB) is optional insurance for any self-broadcast path. `onchainos portfolio all-balances --chain xlayer --chains 196 --address 0x75d0…cf69` currently returns `data:[]`.

### E. CLI validator + token info

```
$ onchainos agent x402-check --endpoint https://x402.dappos.com/healthz
{"ok":true,"data":{"reason":"Endpoint returned HTTP 200 (not 402); not a valid x402 service.","statusCode":200,"valid":false}}

$ onchainos token info --chain xlayer --address 0x779ded0c9e1022225f8e0630b35a9b54be713736
{"chainIndex":"196","decimal":"6","tokenName":"USD₮0","tokenSymbol":"USDT","tagList":{"communityRecognized":true},
 "tokenContractAddress":"0x779ded0c9e1022225f8e0630b35a9b54be713736"}
```

### F. `onchainos agent service-list`, how a service is registered (shape)

Each A2MCP service row (from Onchain Data Explorer #2023): `{ serviceType:"A2MCP", serviceName, endpoint:"https://…", fee:"0.000015", contractAddress:"0x779ded…713736", chainIndex:196 }`. The registered `endpoint` + `fee` + fee-token `contractAddress` + `chainIndex` are what the buyer/validator matches the live 402 against.

### G. OKX Payments SDK, seller wiring (SDK-REPO `demo/x402/src/index.ts`, trimmed)

```ts
import { OKXFacilitatorClient } from "@okxweb3/app-x402-core";
import { x402ResourceServer } from "@okxweb3/app-x402-express";
import { ExactEvmScheme } from "@okxweb3/app-x402-evm/exact/server";

const facilitator = new OKXFacilitatorClient({
  apiKey: process.env.OKX_API_KEY!, secretKey: process.env.OKX_SECRET_KEY!,
  passphrase: process.env.OKX_PASSPHRASE!, baseUrl: "https://web3.okx.com",
});
const server = new x402ResourceServer(facilitator).register("eip155:196", new ExactEvmScheme());
const routes = { "POST /api/mcp-3d": {
  accepts: { scheme: "exact", network: "eip155:196",
             payTo: "0x75d00a2713565171f33216e5aa2a375e076ecf69", price: "$0.000015" },
  mimeType: "application/json" } };
// USD price → USD₮0 atomic auto-converted via DEFAULT_STABLECOINS["eip155:196"] (6 dp).
```

### H. Verification-pass captures (second WO-01 session, 2026-07-06, independent evidence)

#### H.1 Our endpoint's live HTTP-level gate (disproves original G9)

Status matrix, live against production `https://three.ws/api/mcp-3d`:

```
POST tools/call text_to_3d      (bare curl, no MCP headers)  → HTTP/2 402
POST tools/call auto_rig_model  (bare curl, no MCP headers)  → HTTP/2 402
POST tools/call text_to_3d  + header mcp-protocol-version: 2025-06-18 → HTTP/2 401 (OAuth branch)
```

The 402 carries `payment-required: <base64>` (decoded: v2 challenge, `resource` object with
url/description/mimeType/serviceName/tags/iconUrl, Solana USDC `amount "1000"` + Solana
THREE `amount "10000000"` accepts, `bazaar` extension) and
`access-control-allow-headers` ALREADY includes `payment-signature`;
`access-control-expose-headers: PAYMENT-REQUIRED, x-payment-response, …` (needs
`PAYMENT-RESPONSE` added, G8).

#### H.2 `x402-check` against our endpoint and oklink

Ours: `{"valid": true, "x402Version": 2, "scheme": "exact", "network":
"solana:5eykt4UsFv8P8NJdTREpY1vzqKqZKvdp", "asset": "EPjFWdd5…TDt1v", "amountMinimal":
"1000", "amountHuman": 0.001, "decimals": 6, "tokenSymbol": "UNKNOWN", …}`, parses clean;
**no `eip155:196` entry to select** (the rejection, isolated).

oklink (`--body '{"chainIndex":"196"}'`): `"valid": true` plus
`"tokenResolveError": "cannot determine token decimals: token-info lookup failed (asset
0x779ded0c…3736 is not in the task system's supported token list (checked: USDT, USDG)) and
the accepts entry does not provide a 'decimals' field"`, non-fatal; basis for the G3
`extra.decimals` recommendation.

#### H.3 Fee-token on-chain reads (X Layer RPC `https://rpc.xlayer.tech`)

```
name()     → "USD₮0"  (returned bytes 555344e282ae30 = "USD" + U+20AE + "0")
symbol()   → "USD₮0"
decimals() → 6
DOMAIN_SEPARATOR()                        → 0xd591d9baf744328d9400b923cb02c9474d367d591ca1ab24d8c4068be527599d
authorizationState(0x75d0…cf69, 0x00…00)  → 0x00…00  (function exists → EIP-3009 implemented)
eip712Domain()                            → empty (no ERC-5267; domain params come from the recomputation below)
```

Recomputation (ethers v6): `keccak256(abiEncode(keccak256("EIP712Domain(string name,string
version,uint256 chainId,address verifyingContract)"), keccak256("USD₮0"), keccak256("1"),
196, 0x779ded0c9e1022225f8e0630b35a9b54be713736))` =
`0xd591d9ba…599d`, **byte-exact match** with the on-chain `DOMAIN_SEPARATOR()`.
`extra.name = "USD₮0"` / `extra.version = "1"` are therefore cryptographically proven.
A mis-transcribed ₮ (U+20AE) produces invalid signatures, copy the string from this spec.

#### H.4 WIRE-PREDEXON, Predexon #2143 (approved, enforcing, `exact`-only)

`curl -si "https://a2mcp.predexon.com/v1/markets/search?query=btc"` → `HTTP/2 402`, body
`{"error":"payment_required","service":"Predexon Market Search","price":"0.01 USDT0",…}`,
decoded `payment-required`:

```json
{"x402Version":2,"error":"Payment required","resource":{"url":"https://a2mcp.predexon.com/v1/markets/search?query=btc","description":"Search prediction markets across supported venues.","mimeType":"application/json"},"accepts":[{"scheme":"exact","network":"eip155:196","amount":"10000","asset":"0x779ded0c9e1022225f8e0630b35a9b54be713736","payTo":"0xb5c8bbeb50b913ab99e3ff74987405c1de4ea736","maxTimeoutSeconds":300,"extra":{"name":"USD₮0","version":"1"}}]}
```

$0.01 → `"10000"` re-confirms 6-decimal scaling on a third price point. Note
`resource.url` includes the query string of the probed request.

#### H.5 Facilitator auth requirement (live) + second signed leg

`curl -si https://web3.okx.com/api/v6/pay/x402/supported` (no auth) → `HTTP/2 401`
`{"msg":"Request header OK-ACCESS-KEY can not be empty.","code":"50103"}`, HMAC credentials
are required in practice, not just per SDK source.

A second independent `payment pay` + unfunded replay against oklink reproduced PAY-LEG1/2
exactly (`header_name: "PAYMENT-SIGNATURE"`, fresh nonce, `validBefore` = now + 86400;
replay → 402 `"error":"insufficient_balance"` with full fresh challenge). The flow is
deterministic, not a one-off.

#### H.6 XBubbleAI #2087, cautionary non-example

Both `https://x402.dappos.com/healthz` AND the priced
`/okx/a2mcp/bubble-image` answer `HTTP/2 200` to unpaid requests (the latter generated and
returned a real image URL, unpaid). Approved but non-enforcing, 0 sales, approval evidently
predates or ignores runtime enforcement; do NOT copy its behavior, and it explains why
`x402-check` against its healthz returns `valid:false` (Appx E).
