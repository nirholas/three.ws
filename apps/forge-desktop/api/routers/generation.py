    """Normalize a caller-supplied collection name into a safe workspace subfolder.

    The value becomes a directory under the workspace (``WORKSPACE_DIR / collection``), so a
    name carrying a path separator or a drive/wildcard character could escape that root or fail
    to create on Windows. Such a name, or an empty one, falls back to ``"Default"`` rather than
    raising, because a generation the caller already paid for should still land somewhere
    sensible. Shared so every entry point that routes output into a collection sanitizes it the
    same way; a second copy of this rule is a second chance to forget a character.

    Legality and containment are different questions, so they are asked separately: the
    reserved characters above are refused outright, and containment is put to the path
    library rather than to the spelling -- the same ``relative_to`` check
    ``generator_registry._path_belongs_to`` uses, so the two containment checks in this
    backend agree rather than drifting on their own semantics. A character blocklist alone
    lets ``".."`` through -- it contains none of the listed characters -- and
    ``WORKSPACE_DIR / ".."`` resolves to the workspace's *parent*, so the generated mesh
    would land outside the root.

    A name ending in a dot or space is refused too, even once it clears both checks above:
    Windows silently drops trailing dots/spaces from the final path component it actually
    creates, so ``mkdir()`` on ``"Exports..."`` lands in the very same folder as
    ``"Exports"`` -- two collections that look distinct to this function would otherwise
    merge their output on disk without either caller being told.
