# Avatar Creation

Your agent's 3D avatar is what makes it feel real. It is the face people see, the presence they interact with, and the body that expresses emotions, gestures, and personality. This guide covers every way to create one.

## Choosing a path

| Path | Time | Skill required | Best for |
|------|------|----------------|----------|
| Photo → Avaturn AI | 3–5 min | None | A realistic avatar that looks like you |
| Character Studio | 10–20 min | None | A stylized avatar with full creative control |
| Upload your own GLB | 1 min | 3D modeling | An existing model from Blender, Mixamo, RPM, etc. |

Pick one and follow its section below. All three paths produce a GLB file that gets saved to your account.

---

## Path 1: Photo-to-avatar (Avaturn)

The fastest way to get a personalized 3D avatar is to take a set of photos and let Avaturn's AI generate a realistic model from them.

### What you need

Three photos of your face:
- **Frontal** — face the camera straight on, neutral expression
- **Left** — turn your head about 45° to the left
- **Right** — turn your head about 45° to the right

Good lighting and a plain background give the best results. Photos can be JPEG or PNG.

### Steps

1. Go to **https://three.ws/create**
2. Choose **Camera** (to take live photos in-browser) or **Upload** (to pick files from your device)
3. Fill in all three slots — frontal, left, right
4. Select your preferred **body type** and **avatar style** (v1 = photorealistic, v2 = stylized)
5. Click **Submit**

The photos are prepared and sent to the Avaturn pipeline. After a brief processing step, an Avaturn editor opens in a modal where you can adjust clothing, accessories, and other details before exporting.

When you click export, the GLB is fetched and saved to your three.ws account automatically.

### What if camera access doesn't work?

If your browser or device doesn't support `getUserMedia`, the Camera option is disabled automatically and a message is shown. Use the Upload option instead — it accepts any JPEG or PNG file.

### Technical flow

For developers who want to understand what happens under the hood:

1. [selfie-capture.js](../src/selfie-capture.js) manages the two-step UI: method choice (camera vs upload) and the three photo slots. It dispatches a `selfie:submit` CustomEvent when all three slots are filled.
2. [selfie-pipeline.js](../src/selfie-pipeline.js) handles that event: downscales each photo to a max of 1024px, converts to base64 JPEG, then POSTs to `/api/onboarding/avaturn-session` with the photos and body/style preferences.
3. The API responds with a `session_url`. The page redirects to `/#avatarSession=<encoded url>`.
4. The main app reads the hash and opens `AvatarCreator` ([src/avatar-creator.js](../src/avatar-creator.js)) with the session URL, which initialises the Avaturn SDK into a modal iframe.
5. The Avaturn iframe fires a `avatar.exported` postMessage when the user exports. The SDK catches this, fetches the GLB bytes, and calls `onExport(blob)`.
6. [account.js](../src/account.js) → `saveRemoteGlbToAccount()` presigns an upload URL, pushes the GLB to R2 storage, and creates the avatar record.

---

## Path 2: Character Studio

Character Studio is a browser-based avatar builder for full creative control, no photo required.

### Access

Open **https://three.ws/studio**

The studio opens in a modal inside the main app and runs as a separate React application embedded via iframe.

### What you can customize

- Body type and proportions
- Skin tone
- Hair style and color
- Eyes
- Clothing (shirts, jackets, pants, and more)
- Accessories (glasses, hats, and more)

Changes appear in the real-time 3D preview immediately. When you are satisfied, click **Export** to send the GLB back to the main app.

### Technical notes

Character Studio communicates with the parent app via `postMessage`. The message shape is:

```js
{ source: 'characterstudio', type: 'export', glb: ArrayBuffer }
```

[avatar-creator.js](../src/avatar-creator.js) listens for this, wraps the `ArrayBuffer` in a `Blob`, and passes it to `saveRemoteGlbToAccount()`.

The Character Studio URL defaults to `http://localhost:5173` for local development. Production deployments configure it via the `VITE_CHARACTER_STUDIO_URL` environment variable.

---

## Path 3: Upload your own GLB

If you already have a 3D model — from Blender, Maya, Mixamo, Ready Player Me, or anywhere else — you can upload it directly.

### Steps

1. Open **https://three.ws/app**
2. Drag and drop your `.glb` file onto the viewer, or use the file picker in the editor
3. The model loads and validates automatically
4. Save to your account via the editor toolbar

The three.ws viewer accepts any valid glTF 2.0 binary (`.glb`) file. If your model has features like facial blend shapes and a humanoid skeleton, the full emotion and gesture system activates. If it doesn't, the viewer degrades gracefully — no crash, just no facial animation.

### Converting from other formats

| Source format | How to convert |
|---------------|----------------|
| FBX | Blender: File → Import → FBX, then File → Export → glTF 2.0 (.glb) |
| OBJ | Blender: File → Import → Wavefront, rig if needed, export as glTF |
| VRM | VRM files are glTF 2.0 under the hood — rename `.vrm` to `.glb` and it loads |
| Ready Player Me | RPM avatars export as GLB and are compatible out of the box |
| FBX via script | `/scripts/convert-fbx-to-glb.py` is available for batch conversion |

---

## Avatar requirements for full feature compatibility

The viewer works with any GLB. The table below shows what each feature needs:

| Feature | Requirement |
|---------|-------------|
| 3D display | Any valid GLB |
| Facial expressions | Morph targets (blend shapes) — see names below |
| Head tilt and lean | `Head` or `Neck` bone in the skeleton |
| Gesture animations | Named animation clips embedded in the GLB |
| Emotion blending | Morph targets AND Head/Neck bone together |
| AR view | Any GLB — converted automatically |

### Morph target names

The Empathy Layer maps emotions to these exact morph target names. Include them in your model if you want facial animation:

| Morph target | Driven by |
|---|---|
| `mouthSmile` | Celebration (happiness) |
| `mouthOpen` | Celebration + talking |
| `mouthFrown` | Concern |
| `browInnerUp` | Concern + empathy |
| `browOuterUpLeft` | Curiosity |
| `browOuterUpRight` | Curiosity (subtler) |
| `eyeSquintLeft` | Empathy |
| `eyeSquintRight` | Empathy |
| `eyesClosed` | Patience (subtle, not full close) |
| `cheekPuff` | Celebration |
| `noseSneerLeft` | Concern |
| `noseSneerRight` | Concern |

All influences are lerped smoothly every frame (speed ~4.0). Missing targets are silently skipped — you don't need all of them.

### Skeleton naming

The system recognises common humanoid naming conventions. Any of these will work for the head bone:

- `Head`
- `mixamorigHead`
- `Armature:Head` / `rig_Head`
- `CC_Base_Head`

The same stripping logic applies to the Neck bone. If both exist, `Head` is preferred.

### Animation clip names

Gesture clips are triggered by name. The system does a case-insensitive partial match, so a clip named `WaveLeft` will be found by a `wave` trigger. Recommended clip names for built-in gesture slots:

- `idle` — continuous background animation
- `talk` — mouth movement while speaking
- `nod` — brief affirmation
- `wave` — greeting gesture
- `think` — contemplative pose
- `celebrate` — celebration animation
- `concern` — worried or cautious pose

## Regenerating an avatar

After saving an avatar you can trigger a regeneration — a new pass over the mesh, textures, rig, or appearance — without starting from scratch.

Open the editor for your avatar and click the **Regenerate** button. The regeneration panel ([src/editor/regenerate-panel.js](../src/editor/regenerate-panel.js)) offers four modes:

| Mode | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| Re-mesh | Regenerates the topology (polygon structure) |
| Re-texture | Regenerates materials and textures |
| Re-rig | Regenerates the skeleton binding |
| Re-style | Applies a new appearance from a text description |

Each mode accepts optional parameters as a JSON object. The job runs asynchronously and the panel polls for completion every 3 seconds.

**Note:** Avatar regeneration is in limited availability. If your deployment shows a waitlist banner in this panel, email hello@3dagent.ai to join the early access list.

---

## Accessories

Accessories are layered on top of an avatar without modifying the underlying GLB. They are managed by `AccessoryManager` ([src/agent-accessories.js](../src/agent-accessories.js)).

### How accessories work

Each accessory is either:
- A **separate GLB** attached to a named skeleton bone at runtime, or
- A **morph binding** — a name-to-weight map applied to the avatar's existing blend shapes

Accessory state lives in `agent_identities.meta.appearance` and is restored automatically when the agent loads.

### Slots and conflict rules

| Kind | Limit | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| Outfit | One at a time | Replaces the previous outfit |
| Hat | One at a time | Replaces the previous hat |
| Glasses | One at a time | Replaces the previous glasses |
| Earrings | Stackable | Multiple earring accessories can coexist |

The accessory library is served from `/accessories/presets.json`.

---

## Naming your agent

After the avatar is created, set the agent's name. The name appears on the identity card, embed headers, and Open Graph metadata when the agent is shared.

The naming UI ([src/agent-naming.js](../src/agent-naming.js)) validates your input as you type:

- **3–32 characters**
- Letters, numbers, underscores (`_`), and hyphens (`-`) only
- Names are checked for availability against the server in real-time
- Reserved words (admin, root, system, etc.) are blocked

You can also add an optional description (up to 280 characters) which is shown in the agent's public profile.

---

## Saving and publishing

Once your avatar and name are set:

### 1. Save to account (always)

Saving stores the GLB in R2 storage and creates an avatar record in your account. This is free and required before publishing. The avatar is private by default.

### 2. Publish (optional)

Publishing makes the agent publicly accessible and discoverable. The publish flow ([src/editor/publish-modal.js](../src/editor/publish-modal.js)) walks through four steps:

| Step | What happens |
|------|-------------|
| Export | Packages the current editor state |
| Upload | Pushes assets to storage |
| Register | Creates the public agent record |
| Widget | Generates embed snippets |

On success, you receive:
- A **share link** to the agent's public page
- An **iframe snippet** to embed in any website
- A **web component snippet** for use in supported frameworks

### 3. Register on-chain (optional)

For permanent, verifiable identity, you can register the agent on-chain under ERC-8004. This creates a blockchain record linked to a wallet address. Gas fees apply. See the [ERC-8004 documentation](erc8004.md) for details.

## Developer spec: targeting the avatar format

If you are building a tool that generates avatars for three.ws (a pipeline, a custom studio, a converter), target this specification:

| Property | Target |
|----------|--------|
| Format | GLB (binary glTF 2.0) |
| Skeleton | Humanoid rig — Mixamo or VRM-compatible bone naming |
| Animations | Named clips embedded at the root level of the GLB |
| Blend shapes | See morph target table above |
| Textures | PNG (with alpha if needed) or JPEG; KTX2 recommended for production |
| Polygon count | Under 100k triangles for smooth mobile performance |
| File size | Under 20 MB for fast loading; under 5 MB with Draco compression |
| Coordinate system | Y-up, right-handed (glTF default) |

### Communicating with the app

If your tool runs inside an iframe under the `AvatarCreator` modal, send a postMessage when the user exports:

```js
// From inside your iframe
window.parent.postMessage({
  source: 'characterstudio',
  type: 'export',
  glb: arrayBuffer  // ArrayBuffer of the GLB bytes
}, parentOrigin);
```

If your tool uses the Avaturn SDK path, fire the `export` event with `{ url, urlType }` via the Avaturn postMessage protocol. See [avaturn-docs.md](../docs/avaturn-docs.md) for the full Avaturn iframe event reference.

---

## Troubleshooting

**My avatar loads but has no facial expressions**
The model is missing morph targets. Export from Blender with "Shape Keys" enabled, or use Character Studio / Avaturn which include blend shapes by default.

**Head movement doesn't work**
The skeleton doesn't have a bone named `Head` or `Neck` (or a supported variant). Rename the bone in Blender or your DCC, or check for prefix issues (`mixamorigHead` is fine; `armature_root_Head` is not matched).

**The avatar is too large / loads slowly**
Apply Draco compression in Blender (File → Export glTF → Compression) or with `gltf-pipeline -i model.glb -o model-draco.glb --draco.compressMeshes`. Target under 5 MB for embedded use.

**The Camera option is greyed out on the selfie page**
Your browser or device doesn't support `getUserMedia`. This is common on HTTP (non-HTTPS) connections and some desktop browsers. Use the Upload option instead.

**The regeneration panel shows a waitlist message**
The ML regeneration backend is not enabled on this deployment. Join the early access list via hello@3dagent.ai.
