/**
 * The three.ws home relay wire protocol, version 1.
 *
 * This module is pure. It owns the framing, the version negotiation and, most
 * importantly, the allowlist. It has no sockets, no timers and no I/O, so the
 * one part of this system that must never be wrong can be tested exhaustively
 * without a network.
 *
 * ## Why a relay exists at all
 *
 * Home Assistant lives on a LAN. three.ws is served over https from Cloud Run
 * and cannot route to RFC1918 space. The house therefore dials out to us: one
 * outbound WebSocket from a three.ws integration running inside Home Assistant,
 * to this relay. No port is forwarded, nothing listens on the user's network,
 * and no inbound firewall rule is needed.
 *
 * ## Why this is not an HTTP proxy
 *
 * The obvious implementation is "forward any HTTP request into the LAN". That
 * would be the single worst thing this platform could ship: a caller-chosen
 * path into someone's home network. This protocol instead carries a fixed,
 * enumerated set of Home Assistant WebSocket message types, and refuses
 * everything else at both ends.
 *
 * The allowlist below is derived from what `packages/home-bridge` actually
 * sends, which in turn is what `home-assistant-js-websocket` emits for the
 * three channels the product uses: the entity subscription, the four registry
 * reads, and service calls. Nothing else has ever been needed, so nothing else
 * is permitted.
 *
 * ## Where the allowlist is enforced
 *
 * Twice, independently:
 *
 *   1. In the relay (`server.js`), so a compromised or buggy platform-side
 *      caller cannot reach past it.
 *   2. In the integration inside the house (`relay_client.py`), so a compromised
 *      relay cannot either. This is the property that matters: the relay is
 *      operated by us and is therefore exactly the component a user has to
 *      trust least. See `docs/home-relay-threat-model.md`.
 *
 * Both enforcement points import their rules from the same enumeration: this
 * file is the source of truth, and `services/home-relay/allowlist.json` is the
 * generated copy the Python side reads, kept honest by a test.
